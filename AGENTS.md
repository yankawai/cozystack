# AI Agents Overview

This file provides structured guidance for AI coding assistants and agents working with the **Cozystack** project.

## Activation

**CRITICAL**: When the user asks you to do something that matches the scope of a documented process, you MUST read the corresponding documentation file and follow the instructions exactly as written.

- **Commits, PRs, git operations** (e.g., "create a commit", "make a PR", "fix review comments", "rebase", "cherry-pick")
  - Read: [`contributing.md`](./docs/agents/contributing.md)
  - Action: Read the entire file and follow ALL instructions step-by-step

- **Changelog generation** (e.g., "generate changelog", "create changelog", "prepare changelog for version X")
  - Read: [`changelog.md`](./docs/agents/changelog.md)
  - Action: Read the entire file and follow ALL steps in the checklist. Do NOT skip any mandatory steps

- **Release creation** (e.g., "create release", "prepare release", "tag release", "make a release")
  - Read: [`releasing.md`](./docs/agents/releasing.md)
  - Action: Read the file and follow the referenced release process in `docs/release.md`

- **Image references, tags and digests** (e.g., "why is this image tagged rc", "add an image to a package", "change how an image is stamped", "promotion/nightly missed an image", "where do image refs live")
  - Read: [`image-refs.md`](./docs/agents/image-refs.md)
  - Action: Read the entire file. Image refs live in three storage shapes and carry three classes of tag; a tool that knows only one shape skips images silently rather than failing. `hack/lib/image-refs.sh` is the enumeration shared by the promote, retag and mirror tooling — extend it there rather than teaching an individual script a new path. Note `hack/overlay-main-images.sh` is a fourth consumer that still walks the tree itself and does not source the library

- **Project structure, conventions, code layout** (e.g., "where should I put X", "what's the convention for Y", "how is the project organized")
  - Read: [`overview.md`](./docs/agents/overview.md)
  - Action: Read relevant sections to understand project structure and conventions

- **E2E tests and E2E CI** (e.g., "write/fix an e2e test", "stabilize a flaky test", "add a bats test", "change the e2e workflow", "why did e2e fail")
  - Read: [`e2e-testing.md`](./docs/agents/e2e-testing.md)
  - Action: Read the entire file and follow the conventions exactly — no new retries on deterministic steps, event-driven backstops before every `kubectl wait`, no test-level `EXIT`/`RETURN` traps (a self-contained one inside a Chainsaw `script` step or an explicit subshell is fine — see the doc), no assertion beginning with `!` (errexit exempts an inverted status, so it cannot fail — write `if cmd; then echo "FAIL: …"; false; fi`), fail-fast on HelmRelease readiness

- **General questions about contributing**
  - Read: [`contributing.md`](./docs/agents/contributing.md)
  - Action: Read the file to understand git workflow, commit format, PR process

- **Issue and PR labeling, triage** (e.g., "label this issue", "what label should I use", "triage this", "categorize")
  - Read: [`.github/labels.yml`](./.github/labels.yml)
  - Action: Use labels defined there. Conventions follow the Kubernetes scheme — `kind/*` (type), `area/*` (subsystem), `priority/*` (urgency), `triage/*` (review state), `lifecycle/*` (auto-close), `do-not-merge/*` (PR blockers), `security/*` (severity)
  - For `area/*`: accuracy outweighs reuse. If no existing `area/*` truly fits the change, propose a new one via PR (extend `.github/labels.yml` and the scope mapping in `.github/workflows/pr-labeler.yaml`) — do not shoehorn the change into a wrong area. `area/uncategorized` is the auto-labeler fallback; treat it as a signal to pick a fit, create a new area, or correct the PR title
  - PR titles: a Conventional Commits header (`type(scope): description`, types from [`contributing.md`](./docs/agents/contributing.md)) auto-applies `kind/*` and `area/*` via `.github/workflows/pr-labeler.yaml`. Append `!` (or add a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer) to apply `kind/breaking-change`

**Important rules:**
- ✅ **ONLY read the file if the task matches the documented process scope** - do not read files for tasks that don't match their purpose
- ✅ **ALWAYS read the file FIRST** before starting the task (when applicable)
- ✅ **Follow instructions EXACTLY** as written in the documentation
- ✅ **Do NOT skip mandatory steps** (especially in changelog.md)
- ✅ **Do NOT assume** you know the process - always check the documentation when the task matches
- ❌ **Do NOT read files** for tasks that are outside their documented scope
- 📖 **Note**: [`overview.md`](./docs/agents/overview.md) can be useful as a reference to understand project structure and conventions, even when not explicitly required by the task

## Project Overview

**Cozystack** is a Kubernetes-based platform for building cloud infrastructure with managed services (databases, VMs, K8s clusters), multi-tenancy, and GitOps delivery.

## Quick Reference

### Code Structure
- `packages/core/` - Core platform charts (installer, platform)
- `packages/system/` - System components (CSI, CNI, operators)
- `packages/apps/` - User-facing applications in catalog
- `packages/extra/` - Tenant-specific modules
- `cmd/`, `internal/`, `pkg/` - Go code
- `api/` - Kubernetes CRDs

### Conventions
- **Helm Charts**: Umbrella pattern, vendored upstream charts in `charts/`
- **Go Code**: Controller-runtime patterns, kubebuilder style
- **Git Commits**: Conventional Commits (`type(scope): description`) with `--signoff`
- **Prose**: One continuous line per paragraph — see [Prose Formatting](#prose-formatting)

### What NOT to Do
- ❌ Edit `/vendor/`, `zz_generated.*.go`, upstream charts directly
- ❌ Modify `go.mod`/`go.sum` manually (use `go get`)
- ❌ Force push to main/master
- ❌ Commit built artifacts from `_out`
- ❌ Hardwrap a prose paragraph in markdown, a PR body, or an issue comment

## Prose Formatting

Markdown files and everything an agent publishes to GitHub — PR bodies, issue bodies, review comments, release notes — use **one continuous line per paragraph**. Renderers collapse a soft line break into a space, so a paragraph hardwrapped at ~80 columns renders exactly like the same paragraph on one line, while breaking narrow viewports, mangling nested list and table rendering, and turning a one-word edit into a diff that reflows the entire block. The renderer decides where the line ends; the author does not.

Line breaks stay wherever they carry meaning: code fences, one item per list line, tables, headings, blockquotes, front matter, and README badge stacks. The rule governs prose paragraphs and nothing else. Commit messages are the deliberate exception — `git log` and the tooling around it still expect a body wrapped at ~72 columns.

This is the rule LLM agents break most often, because an ~80-column wrap is correct in the places they spend most of their time (Go comments, commit bodies) and the reflex leaks from there into documentation and GitHub. Treat it as a mechanical check at the moment of writing, not as a style preference to weigh: before saving a markdown file or passing `--body` to `gh`, look at each paragraph and confirm it is a single line.

The rule applies to prose this repository owns, and to new or changed paragraphs. Much of the existing tree predates it and is wrapped throughout; that is not a defect to go and fix. Vendored upstream chart docs (`packages/*/*/charts/**`) must stay verbatim — `make update` regenerates them — and published changelogs are historical records. Neither is in scope.

`.claude/hooks/md-no-hardwrap.py` enforces the rule for agents that support PreToolUse hooks (registered for Claude Code in `.claude/settings.json`). It refuses a `Write`/`Edit`/`MultiEdit` that would *add* a hardwrapped paragraph, list item or blockquote to a markdown file, and a `gh` command that would publish one to GitHub. A break counts as added only when the edit wrote both lines it joins, so fixing a typo inside a paragraph that was already wrapped goes through, while rewriting the same file as fresh hardwrapped prose does not. Anything it cannot read with certainty it allows — a guard that blocks legitimate work gets switched off, and then it guards nothing — which includes a body the shell assembles at runtime, and a `--body-file` written by the very command being checked, since the file does not exist yet when the hook runs. `hack/md-no-hardwrap.bats` covers it under `make unit-tests` and requires `python3`. Agents on other harnesses are held to the same rule without the hook.

`.claude/settings.json` is tracked, so keep personal Claude Code overrides in `.claude/settings.local.json`, which is not. A personal `.claude/settings.json` predating this will be overwritten on pull without warning, because git had been ignoring it.
