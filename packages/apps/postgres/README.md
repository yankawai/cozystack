# Managed PostgreSQL Service

PostgreSQL is currently the leading choice among relational databases, known for its robust features and performance.
The Managed PostgreSQL Service takes advantage of platform-side implementation to provide a self-healing replicated cluster.
This cluster is efficiently managed using the highly acclaimed CloudNativePG operator, which has gained popularity within the community.

## Deployment Details

This managed service is controlled by the CloudNativePG operator, ensuring efficient management and seamless operation.

## Operations

PostgreSQL backups have two layers, and the recommended setup uses both
together rather than picking one:

| Layer                                    | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Configured via                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Archive plumbing** (chart, legacy)     | Renders `spec.plugins` (referencing a barman-cloud `ObjectStore`) on the cnpg.io Cluster from helm-install onwards. CNPG runs the barman-cloud plugin as a WAL-archiver sidecar, every WAL switch ships to object storage, and any backup driver gets a complete WAL chain to start replay from. Renders only when `backup.enabled=true`, `useSystemBucket=false`, `destinationPath` is non-empty, AND inline-or-external creds are supplied. **Skipped in the platform `useSystemBucket=true` mode** — the CNPG backup driver SSA-applies the `ObjectStore` and patches `spec.plugins` onto the live Cluster at first BackupJob time; until that first BackupJob fires, plugin WAL archiving is not active and WAL accumulates on the PVC. Fire an ad-hoc BackupJob immediately after enabling the flag on existing releases. | Legacy: `backup.enabled=true` plus `backup.destinationPath`, `backup.endpointURL`, and either `backup.s3AccessKey`+`backup.s3SecretKey` or `backup.s3CredentialsSecret`. Platform: `backup.enabled=true` plus `backup.useSystemBucket=true` — no S3 fields. |
| **Backup orchestration** (recommended)   | Drives ad-hoc and scheduled backups, retention, and restores from `backups.cozystack.io` resources that can span multiple Postgres apps in a tenant. The driver SSA-applies its own barman-cloud `ObjectStore` and patches `spec.plugins` with `ForceOwnership` (so compression / target settings flow from the strategy template, while the live Cluster's `serverName` — its WAL-archive S3 prefix — is always preserved); chart-managed values cover the same destination so there is no tug-of-war on the live Cluster.                                                                                                                                       | `strategy.backups.cozystack.io/CNPG` + `BackupClass` + `Plan` (recurring) or `BackupJob` (ad-hoc), restores via `RestoreJob`                  |
| Legacy chart-emitted scheduled backup    | The chart can also emit a `cnpg.io/ScheduledBackup` directly. Superseded by the BackupClass + Plan path, kept around for clusters that did not migrate. **Off by default** - rendered only when both `backup.enabled` and `backup.schedule` are non-empty. With `backup.schedule=""` plugin WAL archiving still runs; only the chart-emitted scheduled backup is silent.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | `backup.enabled=true` plus `backup.schedule` (CNPG 6-field cron, e.g. `"0 2 * * * *"`)                                                        |

The **canonical setup** depends on whether the cluster ships the platform `cozy-default` BackupClass.

**Platform-managed flow (recommended for new clusters)** — opt in via `backup.useSystemBucket: true` and reference `cozy-default` from BackupJob/Plan/RestoreJob. The chart leaves S3 coordinates blank; the CNPG driver SSA-applies a barman-cloud `ObjectStore` and patches `spec.plugins` from the platform-managed bucket coordinates at first BackupJob time.

```yaml
spec:
  backup:
    enabled: true
    useSystemBucket: true        # platform projects cozy-backups-creds + driver SSA-applies ObjectStore + patches spec.plugins
```

**Legacy chart-managed flow** — for clusters that pre-date the platform BackupClass or use a tuned non-default bucket. Provide all S3 coordinates inline (or via `s3CredentialsSecret.name`); `spec.plugins` and the barman-cloud `ObjectStore` render from helm-install onwards.

```yaml
spec:
  backup:
    enabled: true                # archive WAL to object storage
    destinationPath: s3://my-bucket/pg-src/
    endpointURL: https://seaweedfs-s3.tenant-foo:8333
    s3CredentialsSecret:
      name: pg-src-cnpg-backup-creds
    endpointCA:
      name: pg-src-cnpg-backup-ca
    # backup.schedule intentionally left empty - the BackupClass / Plan
    # below drives recurring backups, no chart-emitted ScheduledBackup
    # should compete with that schedule.
```

paired with a `strategy.backups.cozystack.io/CNPG` + `BackupClass` + `Plan`
in the same tenant. The end-to-end e2e fixture under
[`examples/backups/postgres/`](../../../examples/backups/postgres/) is the
canonical reference (`05-postgres-src.yaml` shows the chart side,
`10-cnpg-strategy.yaml` and `15-backupclass.yaml` show the orchestration
side, `25-backupjob-adhoc.yaml` and `40-restorejob-to-copy.yaml` show
ad-hoc backup and restore).

> **Why both layers and not one?** WAL archiving is handled by the barman-cloud plugin's WAL-archiver sidecar - CNPG can attach or detach the plugin at runtime, but any WAL that closed before the plugin began archiving is gone for good. A backup taken from such a cluster is missing the WAL its `begin_wal` points at, and recovery later fails with `WAL not found`. Letting the chart wire the plugin from helm-install removes the race.

### How to enable backups (preferred: BackupClass + Plan)

End-to-end manifests live under [`examples/backups/postgres/`](../../../examples/backups/postgres/).
Briefly, the moving parts are:

1. A `strategy.backups.cozystack.io/CNPG` describing the destination bucket and templating the barman-cloud `ObjectStore` (including a Secret reference to S3 credentials - the credentials never appear on the Postgres CR `.spec`; see Security note below).
2. A `backups.cozystack.io/BackupClass` that names the strategy and is
   selected by an `applicationRef` matching the Postgres app's `Kind`/`Name`.
3. A `backups.cozystack.io/Plan` (recurring) or `BackupJob` (ad-hoc) that
   references the BackupClass. The controller materialises a
   `Backup` artifact when the cnpg.io Backup completes; restores then
   reference that Backup via `RestoreJob`.

Both in-place restores (overwrite the source app's data) and to-copy
restores (restore into a separate target Postgres app in the same
namespace) are supported via the `RestoreJob.spec.targetApplicationRef`
field.

> **Security:** With the BackupClass path, S3 credentials live in a
> tenant-readable Secret referenced from the strategy template. The CNPG
> driver forwards that Secret reference into the Postgres app's
> `spec.backup.s3CredentialsSecret` on restore, so access keys never land in
> the Postgres CR `.spec`, etcd object store, or `kubectl get -o yaml`
> output. Prefer this over the chart-managed path whenever possible.

### How to enable chart-managed scheduled backups (legacy)

The chart can also emit a `cnpg.io/ScheduledBackup` directly, without a
BackupClass. Superseded by the BackupClass + Plan path above and kept
around for clusters that did not migrate. It does not run by default -
`backup.schedule` defaults to an empty string, which gates the chart's
ScheduledBackup template off. To turn it on, fill in a CNPG 6-field cron
expression:

```yaml
## @param backup.enabled Enable plugin WAL archiving + render the chart-managed ScheduledBackup
## @param backup.schedule Cron schedule (CNPG 6-field). Empty means no chart-managed ScheduledBackup
## @param backup.retentionPolicy Retention policy
## @param backup.destinationPath Path to store the backup (i.e. s3://bucket/path/to/folder)
## @param backup.endpointURL S3 Endpoint used to upload data to the cloud
## @param backup.s3AccessKey Access key for S3, used for authentication
## @param backup.s3SecretKey Secret key for S3, used for authentication
backup:
  enabled: true
  retentionPolicy: 30d
  destinationPath: s3://bucket/path/to/folder/
  endpointURL: http://minio-gateway-service:9000
  schedule: "0 2 * * * *"  # opt in - empty (the default) means no chart-managed schedule
  s3AccessKey: oobaiRus9pah8PhohL1ThaeTa4UVa7gu
  s3SecretKey: ju3eum4dekeich9ahM1te8waeGai0oog
```

### How to recover a backup (preferred: RestoreJob)

For BackupClass-managed backups, create a `backups.cozystack.io/RestoreJob`
that references the desired `Backup`. See
[`examples/backups/postgres/35-restorejob-in-place.yaml`](../../../examples/backups/postgres/35-restorejob-in-place.yaml)
and
[`examples/backups/postgres/40-restorejob-to-copy.yaml`](../../../examples/backups/postgres/40-restorejob-to-copy.yaml).
On a to-copy restore the controller replaces the target app's
`spec.databases` and `spec.users` with the source-spec snapshot persisted
in `Backup.status.underlyingResources`, so the chart's post-install
init-job does not drop the recovered roles or databases.

> **e2e coverage:** the same-namespace to-copy restore (Steps 0-7) leaves
> the source running and is the deterministic end-to-end signal; it stays
> a manual / dev-cluster reference flow, not part of the automated e2e suite.
> The cross-tenant variant (target Postgres in a different tenant from
> the source's seaweedfs) stays a manual / dev-cluster exercise —
> reachability is blocked by the per-tenant Cilium egress policy. The
> in-place restore code path is shipped and is covered at the unit level
> by `TestClusterHasRecoveryBootstrap_TerminatingCluster`,
> `TestCNPGBackupWALArchived`, `TestCNPGPurgeNeeded`, and the rest of the
> `internal/backupcontroller/cnpgstrategy_controller_test.go` suite.

### How to recover a backup (chart-managed bootstrap)

CloudNativePG supports point-in-time-recovery.
Recovering a backup is done by creating a new database instance and restoring the data in it.

Create a new PostgreSQL application with a different name, but identical configuration.
Set `bootstrap.enabled` to `true` and fill in the name of the database instance to recover from and the recovery time:

```yaml
## @param bootstrap.enabled Restore database cluster from a backup
## @param bootstrap.recoveryTime Timestamp (PITR) up to which recovery will proceed, expressed in RFC 3339 format. If left empty, will restore latest
## @param bootstrap.oldName Name of database cluster before deleting
##
bootstrap:
  enabled: false
  recoveryTime: ""  # leave empty for latest or exact timestamp; example: 2020-11-26 15:22:00.00000+00
  oldName: "<previous-postgres-instance>"
```

### How to switch primary/secondary replica

See:

- <https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.15/rolling_update/#manual-updates-supervised>

> `storageClass` is annotated as immutable in the chart schema — see [`docs/storage-immutability.md`](../../../docs/storage-immutability.md) for the contract and which consumers enforce it.

### TLS for server connections

CNPG manages the cert chain end-to-end. The operator auto-generates a self-signed CA, signs server, client, and replication leaf certs from it, and rotates them as needed. The chart does not render any cert-manager `Issuer`/`Certificate` objects — that path is mutually exclusive with the operator-managed chain on the CNPG admission webhook.

What the chart contributes: when TLS is on and `external: true`, the chart sets `spec.certificates.serverAltDNSNames` on the CNPG Cluster CR to inject the external hostname `<release>.<_namespace.host>` into the auto-generated server certificate's SAN list. CNPG's default SAN coverage already includes the three built-in ClusterIP services (`-rw`, `-r`, `-ro`) across the four DNS forms (`<svc>`, `<svc>.<ns>`, `<svc>.<ns>.svc`, `<svc>.<ns>.svc.<cluster-domain>`); only the external hostname needs to be added.

The tri-state `tls.enabled` controls whether the chart injects `serverAltDNSNames`:

- `tls.enabled: null` (the default) — TLS posture inherits from `external`. When `external: true`, the chart injects the external hostname into the operator-managed cert.
- `tls.enabled: true` with `external: true` — same effect as the default.
- `tls.enabled: true` with `external: false` — no `serverAltDNSNames` injection is needed (there is no external hostname to add); CNPG's auto-generated cert covers internal services.
- `tls.enabled: false` — the chart skips `serverAltDNSNames` injection. **Note:** CNPG keeps its built-in TLS on the wire regardless of this flag; this toggle only controls whether the external hostname is added to the cert. To force PostgreSQL to drop TLS entirely you would need to set `postgresql.parameters.ssl = "off"` at the CNPG layer, which is out of scope for this flag.

**Retrieving the CA bundle** for client verification:

The trust anchor is published as `postgres-<name>.tenant-ca`, where `<name>` is the name of the Postgres resource: an object holding `ca.crt` and nothing else, created for every release and delivered to tenants through the `core.cozystack.io/tenantsecrets` API that the base tenant roles already grant. The `postgres-` prefix comes from the release naming this application definition applies, so a Postgres named `foo` gets `postgres-foo.tenant-ca`.

```bash
kubectl --context <ctx> --namespace <tenant> \
  get tenantsecret postgres-<name>.tenant-ca \
  --output jsonpath='{.data.ca\.crt}' | base64 --decode
```

That object is the only one that hands over the CA certificate without also handing over a private key, which is why it exists. CNPG creates its own `<release>-ca` Secret, but that one stores the CA **private key** (`ca.key`) alongside the certificate — read access to it would let the holder issue certificates for anything, so it is never granted to a tenant.

It is reached through `tenantsecrets` rather than by reading the Secret directly, and that is deliberate: `tenantsecrets` surfaces only objects the platform has vouched for (those the application's definition selects), whereas a direct grant on the name would convey whatever happens to occupy that name.

**Connecting with full verification** (psql example):

```bash
psql "host=<host> port=5432 dbname=app user=app \
  sslmode=verify-full sslrootcert=ca.crt"
```

For `sslmode=verify-full` to work, the CA bundle retrieved above must be saved to `ca.crt`. Without it, use `sslmode=require` (encrypts but does not verify the server certificate).

When omitted, the chart injects the SAN if `external: true` and skips it otherwise. Set explicitly to `true` to inject regardless of `external` (no-op when `external: false` since there is no external hostname to add). Set to `false` to skip injection.

| `backup.useSystemBucket`                        | Opt-in: when true, the chart-emitted `<release>-s3-creds` Secret is skipped AND `spec.plugins` (plus the barman-cloud ObjectStore) is left UNSET in the chart-rendered Cluster — the cozy-default BackupClass driver SSA-applies an ObjectStore (carrying destinationPath/endpointURL/credentials) and patches `spec.plugins` on the live Cluster when the first BackupJob runs. Consequence: plugin WAL archiving is NOT active until that first BackupJob fires; WAL accumulates on the PVC in the meantime, so fire an ad-hoc BackupJob immediately after enabling the flag on existing releases. Use together with the platform `cozy-default` BackupClass — tenants do not need to fill `s3AccessKey`/`s3SecretKey` or `destinationPath`/`endpointURL`. The destination path automatically scopes to `s3://cozy-backups/<namespace>/<release>/`. | `bool`   | `false`                             |
| `backup.schedule`                               | Legacy. Cron schedule (CNPG 6-field format) for the chart-emitted ScheduledBackup. Empty means no chart-managed schedule, which is the recommended setup when a `BackupClass` from `backups.cozystack.io` already drives backup orchestration. In the legacy chart-managed flow `spec.plugins` plus the barman-cloud ObjectStore is rendered when `backup.enabled=true` AND `useSystemBucket=false` AND `destinationPath` is non-empty AND inline-or-external creds are supplied; in the platform `useSystemBucket=true` flow the chart skips emitting `spec.plugins` and the CNPG driver SSA-applies the ObjectStore and patches `spec.plugins` onto the live Cluster at first BackupJob time.                                                                                                                                                           | `string` | `""`                                |

| `backup.s3AccessKey`                            | DEPRECATED. Tenants no longer supply S3 keys; the system Bucket Secret is projected into the tenant namespace by the backup controller. Ignored when `s3CredentialsSecret.name` is set or `useSystemBucket` is true. The chart skips materialising `<release>-s3-creds` whenever this field is empty so a default install does not leak placeholder credentials into the tenant namespace.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | `string` | `""`                                |

| `backup.s3CredentialsSecret`                    | DEPRECATED. Pre-existing Secret with S3 credentials. Use the platform-managed `cozy-default` BackupClass instead. When set, the chart references this Secret directly (legacy chart-managed flow).

## Parameter examples and reference

### resources and resourcesPreset

`resources` sets explicit CPU and memory configurations for each replica.
When left empty, the preset defined in `resourcesPreset` is applied.

```yaml
resources:
  cpu: 4000m
  memory: 4Gi
```

`resourcesPreset` sets named CPU and memory configurations for each replica.
This setting is ignored if the corresponding `resources` value is set.

Presets follow a cloud-style `<series>.<size>` naming convention. Five series cover the full CPU-to-memory ratio range (`t1` 1:0.5, `c1` 1:1, `s1` 1:2, `u1` 1:4, `m1` 1:8) and each series ships eight sizes (`nano` through `4xlarge`). The legacy flat names (`nano`, `micro`, `small`, `medium`, `large`, `xlarge`, `2xlarge`) remain accepted as deprecated aliases of their 1:1 instance-type equivalents.

See [`docs/operations/resource-presets.md`](../../../docs/operations/resource-presets.md) for the full size matrix and the legacy-to-instance-type mapping.

### users

```yaml
users:
  user1:
    password: strongpassword
  user2:
    password: hackme
  airflow:
    password: qwerty123
  debezium:
    replication: true
```
