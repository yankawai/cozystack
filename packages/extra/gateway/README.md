# Cozystack Tenant Gateway

Per-tenant Gateway API Gateway backed by Cilium. Installed automatically when `tenant.spec.gateway=true` on the publishing tenant. Other tenants under that tenant inherit through the publishing Gateway without opting in.

The chart renders one `gateway.cozystack.io/v1alpha1 TenantGateway` CR per tenant. The cozystack-controller reconciles the actual `Gateway`, per-tenant `Issuer`, and per-listener `Certificate` resources from there. Helm does not render `Gateway` or `Certificate` directly — that prevents the Helm-vs-controller race on `Gateway.spec.listeners` that ad-hoc HTTPRoute additions would cause.

## Inheritance: when to opt in for a separate Gateway

A tenant gets its own dedicated Gateway (own LB Service, own LB IP, own Certificate) only when it explicitly asks via `tenant.spec.gateway=true`. Every other tenant in the tree attaches its routes to the Gateway of the nearest ancestor that does own one — same shape as `_namespace.ingress` inheritance today.

The `apps/tenant` chart writes a namespace label `namespace.cozystack.io/gateway: <owner-tenant-name>` onto each tenant namespace, carrying either this tenant's own name (when owning a Gateway) or the inherited ancestor name (when inheriting). The Gateway's listener `allowedRoutes.namespaces.selector` is keyed on that label, so the same logic permits the inheriting tenant's HTTPRoutes / TLSRoutes to attach. cozystack-controller separately patches the same label onto every namespace in `tgw.Spec.AttachedNamespaces` so cozy-* system namespaces (cert-manager, monitoring, harbor, …) reach the publishing Gateway alongside the tenant tree, garbage-collecting labels it wrote when an entry is removed from the attach list.

Owning a separate Gateway makes sense for: a tenant that needs its own LB IP (DNS already pinned, firewall rule on a specific address), a tenant whose apex is not derived from the parent (custom `host`, e.g. `customer1.io` not under the platform apex — the ancestor's cert/Issuer can't cover it), or a tenant that wants its own ACME account / cert authority. Otherwise leave `gateway` unset and inherit.

## Cert mode: HTTP-01 (default) vs DNS-01 (opt-in) vs existing Secret

The platform-wide `publishing.certificates.solver` value selects how the controller sources TLS certificates for the tenant Gateway. Setting `publishing.certificates.wildcardSecretName` switches to a third mode (existing Secret) that overrides the solver entirely — see below.

### Default — HTTP-01

Out of the box, no extra config required. The controller:

- Renders an ACME `Issuer` in the tenant namespace with an `http01.gatewayHTTPRoute` solver pointing at the tenant's own Gateway / `http` listener.
- Watches HTTPRoutes / TLSRoutes attached to the Gateway (parentRefs pointing at it). For each unique hostname seen, it adds a per-app HTTPS listener and a per-app `Certificate` (dnsNames containing exactly that hostname).
- Per-app listener naming: `https-<first-label-of-hostname>` (e.g. `https-harbor`).
- Per-app cert naming: `<tgw-name>-<first-label>-tls`.

Adding a new published app is purely a matter of deploying its HTTPRoute — no edits to `_cluster.expose-services` needed.

### Opt-in — DNS-01

Set `publishing.certificates.solver: dns01` and configure the provider under `publishing.certificates.dns01.*` in the platform chart values. Each provider reads its own sub-block; others are ignored.

| Provider     | `publishing.certificates.dns01.provider` | Required `publishing.certificates.dns01.<provider>` keys                                  |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cloudflare   | `cloudflare` (default)                   | `cloudflare.secretName`, `cloudflare.secretKey`                                           |
| AWS Route53  | `route53`                                | `route53.region`, `route53.secretName` (and `route53.accessKeyID` if not using IRSA)      |
| DigitalOcean | `digitalocean`                           | `digitalocean.secretName`                                                                 |
| RFC 2136     | `rfc2136`                                | `rfc2136.nameserver`, `rfc2136.tsigKeyName`, `rfc2136.secretName`                         |

The platform chart writes those values into `_cluster.dns01-*` keys consumed by the per-tenant gateway chart, which renders them onto the `TenantGateway` CR. Each provider sub-block carries safe defaults for secret-key field names (`api-token`, `secret-access-key`, `access-token`, `tsig-secret-key`) so the typical opt-in path is `solver: dns01` plus the provider-specific `secretName` (and `region` for route53 / `nameserver`+`tsigKeyName` for rfc2136).

DNS-01 mode renders a single wildcard `Certificate` covering `<apex>` and `*.<apex>`, plus the corresponding `https` (`*.<apex>`) and `https-apex` (`<apex>`) listeners. New apps published under the apex pick up the existing wildcard cert without per-listener provisioning.

For inheriting child tenants under this Gateway: the controller extends the same wildcard Certificate with `<child-apex>` + `*.<child-apex>` SANs per child, and adds one `*.<child-apex>` listener per child apex referencing the same cert. Child apex SANs are discovered by listing namespaces carrying `namespace.cozystack.io/gateway = <owner>` and reading their `namespace.cozystack.io/host` label. The ACME challenge must succeed for every SAN, which means the DNS provider account configured at the platform layer must be able to write TXT records under each child apex zone — for deeply-nested children that requires either zone delegation or a provider account with apex-spanning permissions.

Pick DNS-01 when you specifically want a wildcard cert (e.g. a long-lived staging cluster with many short-lived apps and tight LE rate limits). Otherwise stay on HTTP-01.

> **Listener-cap considerations.** Gateway API caps `Gateway.spec.listeners` at 64. In HTTP-01 mode, every published hostname adds one HTTPS listener, plus the mandatory `http` listener and one extra per TLS-passthrough service — so a tenant approaching 60+ published apps on HTTP-01 hits the spec cap and the rendered `Gateway` fails admission. DNS-01 mode collapses every hostname under the apex into one wildcard listener and is the right choice for high-fanout single-tenant deployments.

### Opt-in — existing wildcard Secret (operator-provided)

Set `publishing.certificates.wildcardSecretName` in the platform chart values to point the tenant Gateway at a pre-existing wildcard TLS Secret instead of issuing anything via ACME. Use this when the operator already holds a wildcard certificate — purchased, or issued by a corporate CA — and wants platform services to serve under it. This mode takes precedence over `solver`: when `wildcardSecretName` is set, the solver / provider / issuer values are ignored.

The platform chart writes the value into `_cluster.wildcard-secret-name` (the name only — the certificate and private key never travel on the values channel), and the gateway chart renders `certMode: existingSecret` with `wildcardSecretRef.name` on the `TenantGateway` CR. The controller then:

- Mints no `Issuer` and no `Certificate`. Switching into this mode from HTTP-01 or DNS-01 garbage-collects the now-unused per-tenant `Issuer` and any per-listener / wildcard `Certificate` the controller previously owned.
- Renders the same single-wildcard listener shape as DNS-01: a `https` (`*.<apex>`) listener and a `https-apex` (`<apex>`) listener (plus one `*.<child-apex>` listener per inheriting child), all with `certificateRefs` pointing at the operator-supplied Secret.

The Secret must exist in the `TenantGateway`'s own namespace, be of type `kubernetes.io/tls`, and cover the apex (and `*.<apex>`). Cross-namespace references are intentionally unsupported (no `ReferenceGrant`), so each per-tenant Gateway reads the Secret from its own namespace. For the root publishing tenant that is the operator-created Secret in `tenant-root`. For a child tenant that runs its own Gateway, the platform controller replicates the operator Secret into the tenant namespace automatically — it reads the source name from the same `publishing.certificates.wildcardSecretName` that drives the consumers, so a same-named replica is mirrored into every tenant namespace that owns a termination point, then garbage-collected when wildcard mode is explicitly disabled (clearing `publishing.certificates.wildcardSecretName`) or when a tenant stops terminating TLS. A transient absence of the source Secret or the platform values channel does not prune existing replicas. No extra operator input, and the replica carries no extra RBAC — the Gateway reads only its own-namespace copy. Replication delivers the bytes, not coverage: the certificate matches a child apex only if its SAN list does, and a single `*.<apex>` does not match `*.<child-apex>`. The controller still renders a `*.<child-apex>` listener bound to the Secret for each inheriting child, so when the SANs do not cover that apex, clients of the child subdomain are served the parent certificate and see a hostname-mismatch TLS error — supply a certificate whose SANs cover the child apexes you intend to serve. Like DNS-01, this mode collapses every hostname under the apex into one wildcard listener, so it is also a way to stay clear of the 64-listener cap.

## External IP allocation

The per-tenant Gateway's auto-created `LoadBalancer` Service draws its IP from whatever LB allocator the cluster admin has configured at the platform layer — same shape as ingress-nginx today. Cozystack itself ships MetalLB installed but does not render any `IPAddressPool` / `L2Advertisement` / `BGPAdvertisement` from this chart; admins set up the allocator that suits their environment (MetalLB pool with L2 / BGP, Cilium LB-IPAM with announcer, robotlb against a cloud provider, or `Service.spec.externalIPs` pinning).

The tenant API stays mechanism-agnostic — no `gatewayIP` field, no allocator-specific manifest in the tenant chart. If a tenant needs a specific address (DNS already pinned, firewall rule, etc.), the operator pre-allocates it on the admin side: either pre-create the Service with `loadBalancerIP` set, or hand the tenant a reference to a named admin-managed pool. Per-Service IP uniqueness is the allocator's responsibility and works the same way as for any other LoadBalancer Service in the cluster.

## Security model

Tenants in Cozystack interact with the platform exclusively through `apps.cozystack.io/*` resources (Tenant, Bucket, Kubernetes, …) served by `cozystack-api`. Tenant RBAC (`cozy:tenant:*` aggregated to a RoleBinding in the tenant's own namespace) does not grant write access to `gateway.networking.k8s.io/*`, core `Namespaces`, or `cozystack.io/Package`. Every layer below is shaped by that constraint — the security model is built around the `apps.cozystack.io/*` API surface, not around Gateway API admission.

The protections below split into three groups by who they defend against:

- **Tenant-user-input gates** — Layer 4 (`cozystack-tenant-host-policy`). `Tenant.spec.host` is the user-supplied field that surfaces as a security boundary at the hostname layer; it is gated on every Create / Update via `cozystack-api`'s admission chain (`pkg/registry/apps/application/rest.go`).
- **Defense-in-depth** — Layers 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8. These do not protect against tenant-user input (tenants don't hold the relevant RBAC). They guard against bugs in cozystack-controller / Flux, supply-chain compromise of an app chart that emits Gateway API or Ingress resources, and confused-deputy mistakes by a cluster admin. Fail-closed via `failurePolicy: Fail` + `validationActions: [Deny]`. Layers 1-7 cover the opt-in Gateway API dataplane; Layer 8 covers the legacy Ingress dataplane, which is the default (Gateway API is off by default).
- **Admin-against-themselves** — Layer 3 (`cozystack-gateway-attached-namespaces-policy`). Rejects a `kubectl edit packages.cozystack.io` that would slip a `tenant-*` entry into the platform Package's `gateway.attachedNamespaces`. Layer 6 catches the same misconfiguration at helm render time.

1. **Namespace whitelist on listeners.** Every listener carries an `allowedRoutes.namespaces.from: Selector` matching the built-in `kubernetes.io/metadata.name` label (written by kube-apiserver, unspoofable). HTTPS / TLS-passthrough listeners accept routes from the publishing tenant's namespace plus `gateway.attachedNamespaces` in the platform chart (default includes the `cozy-*` namespaces for platform services and `default` for the Kubernetes API TLSRoute). A namespace outside the list literally cannot attach any `HTTPRoute` or `TLSRoute` to those listeners. The plain-HTTP listener (port 80) carries a strictly narrower selector — only the tenant namespace itself and `cozy-cert-manager`. Both the controller-owned http→https redirect HTTPRoute and cert-manager's HTTP-01 challenge route live in the tenant namespace, the latter because cert-manager creates the Challenge, and with it the solver route, in the Certificate's own namespace; the `cozy-cert-manager` entry is not exercised by that path — so app HTTPRoutes attaching by hostname cannot bind to port 80 and serve plaintext. HTTPS listeners additionally restrict `allowedRoutes.kinds` to `HTTPRoute` (and TLS-passthrough listeners to `TLSRoute`), preventing GRPCRoute / TCPRoute / UDPRoute from attaching outside the route-hostname VAP's coverage.
2. **`cozystack-gateway-hostname-policy`** — `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy` on `gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1 Gateway` CREATE/UPDATE. Reads `namespaceObject.metadata.labels["namespace.cozystack.io/host"]` and rejects any listener hostname that is not equal to that value or a subdomain of it. `matchConditions` gate the VAP to cozystack-managed namespaces only — Gateways in unrelated namespaces (e.g. `kube-system`) are not touched.
3. **`cozystack-gateway-attached-namespaces-policy`** — VAP on `cozystack.io/v1alpha1 Package` CREATE/UPDATE. Rejects any `tenant-*` entry in `spec.components.platform.values.gateway.attachedNamespaces`. Catches direct `kubectl edit packages.cozystack.io` that would bypass the helm render-time guard in layer 6.
4. **`cozystack-tenant-host-policy`** — VAP on `apps.cozystack.io/v1alpha1 Tenant` CREATE/UPDATE. Rejects setting or changing `spec.host` unless the caller's groups contain `system:masters`, `system:serviceaccounts:cozy-system`, `system:serviceaccounts:cozy-cert-manager`, `system:serviceaccounts:cozy-fluxcd` or `system:serviceaccounts:kube-system`. Closes the path where a tenant user sets `spec.host=dashboard.example.org` on their own tenant to have the tenant chart write a hijacked label into the namespace.
5. **`cozystack-namespace-host-label-policy`** — VAP on core `v1 Namespace` CREATE/UPDATE. Rejects any set or change of the `namespace.cozystack.io/host` label, except by the same trusted-caller whitelist as layer 4. This closes both first-time label writes on CREATE and first-time adds on UPDATE — only cozystack/Flux service accounts (which apply the tenant chart) can stamp the label.
6. **Render-time `fail` in cozystack-basics.** The cozystack-basics chart fails the helm render if `_cluster.gateway-attached-namespaces` contains any `tenant-*` entry. Triggers on the helm-install path before the cluster ever sees the values — complements layer 3 which triggers at `kubectl apply` time.
7. **`cozystack-route-hostname-policy`** — VAP on `gateway.networking.k8s.io` HTTPRoute and TLSRoute CREATE/UPDATE. The rules name `v1`/`v1beta1` for HTTPRoute and `v1alpha2` for TLSRoute, which covers every served version of both: `matchConstraints.matchPolicy` defaults to `Equivalent`, so the apiserver converts a request made at another version into the listed one before the policy sees it. Scoped to `tenant-*` namespaces (cozy-* are cluster-admin-managed and trusted to publish under any apex). Requires `spec.hostnames` to be present and non-empty, and rejects any entry that is not equal to the namespace's `namespace.cozystack.io/host` label or a subdomain of it. A route that names no hostname is not inert: it inherits the hostnames of every listener it attaches to, and `parentRefs` may name a Gateway in another namespace, so admitting it unchecked would let it cover whatever that listener covers. A VAP cannot resolve the parent Gateway to learn which hostnames would be inherited, so the policy requires the route to name its own. The controller-owned http-to-https redirect names the tenant apex and its wildcard for this reason. Defense-in-depth against an app chart bug or supply-chain compromise that emits Gateway API resources outside the tenant's apex — tenants in Cozystack do not hold `gateway.networking.k8s.io/*` RBAC by design, so this is not a tenant-user defense. The within-apex cross-namespace case (a tenant chart claiming a hostname that is published by a `cozy-*` app) is handled by the controller at reconciliation time: when two routes from different namespaces claim the same hostname, the `cozy-*` namespace wins and the loser receives a `HostnameConflict` condition under the controller's name in `Status.Parents`.
8. **`cozystack-ingress-hostname-policy`** — VAP on core `networking.k8s.io/v1 Ingress` CREATE/UPDATE. Gateway API is opt-in and **off by default**, so in the default configuration tenant applications publish through a legacy Ingress on the shared ingress-nginx; layers 1-7 constrain tenant hostnames on the opt-in Gateway path, and this VAP adds a hostname constraint on the default Ingress path. Scoped to `tenant-*` namespaces (cozy-* are cluster-admin-managed and trusted). A hostname on `spec.rules[].host` or `spec.tls[].hosts[]` is allowed when it is within the namespace's own `namespace.cozystack.io/host` apex, OR when it lies entirely outside the platform root apex (`_cluster.root-host`) — the second case lets a tenant route its own external custom domain (for example the `kubernetes` app's Proxied `addons.ingressNginx.hosts`, which routes a user-supplied domain to a nested cluster). A hostname that falls under the platform root apex but outside the namespace's own apex is rejected; a rule with no host (an unbounded catch-all) and `spec.defaultBackend` (a catch-all for unmatched traffic) are also rejected. Fail-closed: a `tenant-*` namespace missing its host label is denied, and the policy renders only when `_cluster.root-host` is set. This bounds which apexes a tenant Ingress may claim under the platform domain; it does not attempt to resolve every possible hostname collision.

For `tenant-root` the allowed host suffix is `publishing.host`; for any `tenant-<name>` that inherits from its parent the suffix is `<name>.<parent apex>`. A child tenant with an independent apex (`customer1.io` instead of a subdomain) is handled correctly because the VAP reads the per-namespace label rather than assuming a subdomain hierarchy.

## Rate limits

cert-manager issues per-listener `Certificate` resources in HTTP-01 mode (one per published app), or a single wildcard `Certificate` per tenant in DNS-01 mode. With `issuerName: letsencrypt-prod` (the default), every certificate counts against the [Let's Encrypt rate limits](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/):

- 50 new certificates per registered domain per week.
- 5 duplicate certificates per week for the same set of hostnames.
- 300 new orders per account per 3 hours.

A cluster where many tenants share the same apex domain can exhaust these quickly, especially in HTTP-01 mode where each published app contributes one certificate. Mitigations:

- Use `publishing.certificates.issuerName: letsencrypt-stage` for non-production clusters (staging does not count against prod quotas).
- Limit the number of simultaneous tenant Gateways per cluster via the platform's package quota, or cap it via `tenant.spec.resourceQuotas` with `count/certificates.cert-manager.io` to limit how many `Certificate` objects a tenant may create.
- Switch to DNS-01 to consolidate every tenant's apps under one wildcard cert (cuts cert count from N apps to 1).
- For bare-metal or air-gapped deployments consider an internal ACME server or the self-signed `ClusterIssuer` (`selfsigned-cluster-issuer`) that ships alongside the Let's Encrypt issuers.

Recommended tenant-level quota to contain a misbehaving tenant:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps.cozystack.io/v1alpha1
kind: Tenant
spec:
  gateway: true
  resourceQuotas:
    count/certificates.cert-manager.io: "10"
```

The default for a fresh tenant is unlimited; operators running shared-apex multi-tenant clusters should set this explicitly (or stage it via the tenant-application default values) before opening `gateway: true` to non-trusted tenants.

## Known limitations

- **Upstream application gaps** — some chart-level features (harbor ACL integrations, bucket upstream limitations) remain on ingress-nginx workflows in upstream docs; cozystack tracks those separately as upstream PRs.
- **Supported ACME issuers** — `publishing.certificates.issuerName` for Gateway-based tenants must be `letsencrypt-prod` or `letsencrypt-stage` (the controller maps those names to concrete ACME server URLs). To support another ACME provider, extend the controller's renderer with an additional branch.
- **DNS-01 wildcards require DNS provider access for every apex level** — when a deeply nested tenant (e.g. `tenant-root` → `alice` → `alice-prod`) inherits DNS-01 mode, the parent's `*.alice.example.org` SAN requires the parent's ACME challenge to write a TXT record under `_acme-challenge.alice.example.org`. If the operator hasn't delegated that subzone to the parent's DNS provider account, cert issuance for the grandchild apex stalls. HTTP-01 mode is unaffected — each per-listener challenge runs against the specific hostname.
- **Cilium sharing-key port-collision** — operators wanting *multiple* per-tenant Gateways to share a single LB IP cannot do so on current Cilium: every tenant Gateway claims `443/TCP`, so `lbipam.cilium.io/sharing-key` is inactive on port collision ([cilium#21270](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues/21270), [cilium#42756](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues/42756)). Each Gateway → own LB IP until Cilium ships ListenerSet. Within a single Gateway, inheritance (parent + all inheriting children sharing one IP) works today.
- **Upstream application gaps** — some chart-level features (harbor ACL integrations, bucket upstream limitations) remain on ingress-nginx workflows in upstream docs; cozystack tracks those separately as upstream PRs.
- **Supported ACME issuers** — `publishing.certificates.issuerName` for Gateway-based tenants must be `letsencrypt-prod` or `letsencrypt-stage` (the controller maps those names to concrete ACME server URLs). To support another ACME provider, extend the controller's renderer with an additional branch.
