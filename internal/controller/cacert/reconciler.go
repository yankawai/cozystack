// Package cacert extracts the trust anchor of a managed application into a
// canonical, key-free Secret the tenant can read.
//
// Every engine in the catalog issues a per-release CA, but the object that
// holds ca.crt almost always holds a private key next to it: the cert-manager
// CA Secret carries tls.key, CloudNativePG's <release>-ca carries ca.key.
// Handing a tenant the trust anchor by granting read on one of those objects
// hands over key material too. The consume contract is therefore one canonical
// object per release — an Opaque Secret named "<release>.tenant-ca" holding
// ONLY ca.crt — and this controller produces it, so a tenant learns exactly one
// name. The dot in that name is load-bearing; see projectionSuffix.
//
// # The declaration is a namespaced sentinel
//
// A chart declares that one of its Secrets should be published to the tenant by
// rendering a TenantProjection (internal.cozystack.io/v1alpha1) named after the
// release. The sentinel is the reconcile unit, and its spec names the source
// Secret and the key to lift. No tenant RBAC role grants any verb on
// internal.cozystack.io, so a tenant cannot forge a sentinel to publish a CA of
// their choosing. That RBAC boundary is the whole control: the group is out of
// tenant reach, which is why the sentinel lives in it.
//
// # Why the owner is the sentinel, not the HelmRelease
//
// The lineage admission webhook decides whether the tenant may read the
// projection, and it derives that by walking owner references up to a
// HelmRelease (pkg/lineage/lineage.go). The projection references the sentinel;
// the sentinel carries NO owner reference and instead the helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/name
// label Flux stamps on every rendered object, which the same walk resolves to
// the HelmRelease as a fallback. So the chain
// projection → sentinel → HelmRelease → application resolves through unmodified
// lineage code, and the projection gets the internal.cozystack.io/tenantresource
// label that lets the tenant read it through the tenantsecrets API.
//
// # What this controller does NOT decide
//
// It does not grant the tenant read access, and cannot. That verdict belongs to
// the lineage admission webhook, which derives it from the ApplicationDefinition's
// spec.secrets selectors and stamps internal.cozystack.io/tenantresource — "true"
// or "false" — overwriting whatever the writer put there.
//
// This controller's side of the contract is to stamp
// internal.cozystack.io/tenant-ca on the projection — the single engine-agnostic
// label a definition's spec.secrets can select on — and to make sure the webhook
// is asked again whenever those selectors change; see SelectorsDigestAnnotation.
//
// Until a definition actually carries that selector, projections are produced
// and kept correct but are marked tenantresource=false, and no tenant can read
// one. Converging the per-engine definitions is deliberately separate work.

	// the sentinel IS reconciled (definitions are watched), but the data, labels,

	// the write — and with no write there is no admission, so the verdict is
	// never revisited and the tenant stays locked out of a Secret that is now
	// theirs. Making the selectors part of the drift check is half of closing
	// that: they change, so exactly one write happens.

	// The write is only half because a write is not an admission. The webhook is

// spec.projections.sourceSecretName; the reconcile then reads the one source it
// needs through the uncached Reader. ApplicationDefinitions are watched so a
// change to the selectors that decide tenant visibility takes effect without
// waiting for the resync.
//
// The SAME metadata Secret cache also feeds a second mapping: the projection this
// controller writes is itself a Secret, and an in-place rewrite of its ca.crt (a
// tamper the owner-reference adoption gate then heals) must wake the reconciler at
// once, not five minutes later on the resync. The projection's name is
// "<release>.tenant-ca", which matches no sentinel's sourceSecretName, so the
// source index never enqueues it; projectionsForOwnedProjection resolves the
// owning sentinel from the projection's controller owner reference instead.
// Owns(&corev1.Secret{}) would be the obvious wiring and is a TRAP here: it
// registers against the MANAGER's cache, whose Secret informer is label-scoped to
// the WildcardSecret replicas (below), so a projection — which carries no wildcard
// label — is never delivered and the watch silently never fires.
//
// The Secret watch runs on secretMetaCache, a DEDICATED cache, NOT the manager's.
// It cannot use the manager's cache, and the reason is a controller-runtime trap
// rather than a preference: that cache scopes its v1/Secret informer to the
// WildcardSecret reconciler's replicas with a label selector (see main.go), a
// metadata informer for the same GVK routes to that same per-GVK cache
// (delegatingByGVKCache keys on GVK, and a PartialObjectMetadata typed as Secret
// resolves to v1/Secret), and the selector is applied to every informer in it —
// metadata included. On the manager cache this watch would therefore silently
// never fire for a CA source, which carries no wildcard label, and the projection
// would appear only on the slow resync. A dedicated cache holds Secret metadata
// stubs cluster-wide, unscoped and key-free, so every source's creation and
