// Package render maps a fully-resolved SiteRouter routed configuration
// into VyOS configuration operations consumed by the vyos.Client.

// of vyos.Operation values from a fully-resolved Inputs struct. The
// SiteRouter controller is responsible for resolving HelmRelease values,
// discovered NIC devices and Secret-backed credentials into Inputs
// before calling Render.
//
// Scope is the Phase-1 routed feature set (DECISIONS.md D3/D12):
// interfaces, management firewall, IPsec site-to-site (forced UDP
// encapsulation), static routes and BGP, plus the two net-new domains
// (MSS clamp, tunnel-ingress source allow-list). NAT/DNAT (Phase 2
// site-gateway) and HA/VRRP (Phase 4) are deliberately absent.
