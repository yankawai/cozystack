# Suite-wide invariant for hack/e2e-chainsaw: a test that applies a tenant
# `Kubernetes` CR ends only after that release's install action has returned.
#
# A Helm release cannot be uninstalled while its install action is still
# running, so a test that finishes its assertions mid-install leaves the rest of
# the install to be paid by Chainsaw's cleanup phase, on top of the teardown,
# against the single `cleanup` budget in hack/e2e-chainsaw/.chainsaw.yaml. The
# suite is then reported red on a cleanup step that tests nothing, seconds after
# every assertion passed. Both OIDC fixtures used to do exactly that: they
# deleted the CR three seconds after creating it, and across 19 in-tree E2E runs
# spent a median of 233s in cleanup against a 300s budget, crossing it in 3 of 38
# measured teardowns. Method, so the figure can be refuted rather than taken on
# trust: the 19 are every `Pull Request` workflow run in the window 31315492733
# to 31373204907 whose `E2E (in-tree)` job log was still retrievable, and each
# teardown is the wall-clock between that job's own `CLEANUP | BEGIN` and
# `CLEANUP | END`/`ERROR` lines for the two suites -- exact log timestamps, not
# event ages. The three that crossed are runs 31317302815, 31337303277 and
# 31373204907. 233s is the median of the 35 that finished; their maximum was 263s,
# and the three that did not finish are censored at the 300s ceiling rather than
# measured.
#
# Corroborated on a second, independent run: 31582632048, a different PR at head
# 5e470d507, where kubernetes-oidc-customconfig passed all four of its steps in
# 4.4556s with no failed assert and then took CLEANUP | ERROR with
# `context deadline exceeded`. From CLEANUP | BEGIN at 11:18:37.6723300 to
# CLEANUP | ERROR at 11:23:37.6720118 that is 299.9997s -- the 5m cleanup budget
# exhausted to within a third of a millisecond. Note which mark the clock starts
# on: measured from DELETE OK instead it reads 299.887s, and quoting that figure
# makes an exhausted budget look like a near miss.
#
# What the second run adds is provenance rather than sample size: it was reached
# from the symptom by someone who did not know this file was being written, so the
# mechanism is identifiable without the derivation below rather than fitted to it.
# What it does not add is an upper bound on the byo teardown -- that suite is
# censored at the budget in both runs, so two observations agree it exhausts 300s
# and neither shows what it would need.
#
# For the `Kubernetes` kind the install action outlives the render-side asserts
# by design. The kind carries release.cozystack.io/helm-install-disable-wait
# (packages/system/kubernetes-rd/cozyrds/kubernetes.yaml), so the install does
# not wait for the in-tenant addon HelmReleases -- but it does still wait for
# the chart's blocking post-install hook Jobs, and one of those polls for the
# Kamaji-issued admin kubeconfig. Asserting the HelmRelease Ready is what makes
# that wait explicit: it spends the same wall-clock against an assert with its
# own timeout and its own diff on failure, and leaves cleanup paying for the
# teardown alone.
#
# The rule is therefore two asserts on the LAST step: the release's HelmRelease
# at Ready, and then its `<release>-oidc-bootstrap` Job at `status.succeeded`.
# Both, because they are not interchangeable. The Job is the OIDC payload and
# survives its own success, so it can be named; the other blocking hook Job
# deletes itself on success and cannot be, which is what the HelmRelease assert
# covers. In that order, because the Ready wait is the one that has to carry a
# budget: a release cannot be Ready until every blocking hook Job has succeeded,
# so once it is, the Job assert reads a settled object instead of waiting for it,
# and one step does not get to spend two install-sized budgets in series.
#
# Checked by NAME and by FIELD rather than by shape, so that "the last step
# asserts something" cannot satisfy this. The expected names are derived, not
# hard-coded: `<release>` is the applied CR's own name behind the `release.prefix`
# the Kubernetes ApplicationDefinition declares, so a renamed fixture or a
# changed prefix moves the expectation with it instead of silently passing.
#
# On the LAST step, because a wait parked earlier lets the steps after it end
# the test mid-install again, and Chainsaw v0.2.15 has no test-level equivalent
# to hang it on. Note what this guard does NOT do: it says nothing about how
# long the teardown itself may take. Chainsaw's cleanup stays bounded and
# blocking, and a genuinely stuck uninstall still fails the suite -- see
# docs/agents/e2e-testing.md, "Do not mask cleanup or teardown failures".
#
# Discovery is generic: any future suite that applies a `Kubernetes` CR through
# `apply.file` is checked here without being named below. The walk runs in both
# directions, because a one-directional one goes quiet in exactly the case that
# matters: "did I find any fixture at all" stays true while one of two has
# dropped out of the match. So the manifests are enumerated from disk as well, and
# one that no Test claims is a discovery miss rather than a rule nobody is held
# to.
#
# What this checks about the budgets is only their relation to each other: the
# Job's must be shorter than the Ready one, and both must be readable. The Ready
# budget's own VALUE is argued in the fixture and held by review, not here -- it
# is derived there from the slowest legitimate install path and from what the
# whole failure path costs against the CI job cap, neither of which this guard can
# see. So `timeout: 6m` on a Ready assert passes here while contradicting that
# reasoning. Deliberate: pinning the value would mean reading the
# ApplicationDefinition's install timeout, the job cap and the catch budgets, and
# a guard assembled from three moving numbers reds on every legitimate change to
# any of them.
#
# `apply.file` is the limit of that reach, and there are TWO ways out of it, not
# one. The nearer one: a fixture that inlines the CR as `apply.resource:` leaves
# no manifest on disk, so neither direction of the walk can see it --
# `_tenant_cluster_manifests` skips `chainsaw-test.yaml` by name and the reverse
# case enumerates only sibling manifests, so nothing reds.
# `hack/e2e-chainsaw/gateway/chainsaw-test.yaml` already uses that form for other
# kinds. The farther one: a suite that creates its tenant cluster from a script --
# kubernetes-latest and kubernetes-previous do, from a heredoc in
# _lib/run-kubernetes.sh -- is invisible to this walk. Both of those wait far past
# install for worker nodes, so neither violates the rule in substance, but a
# future script-driven fixture would be green here while breaking it.
# docs/agents/e2e-testing.md carries the same qualifier so the checklist does not
# promise a machine check that does not exist.
#
# There is no exemption for a fixture whose subject is a FAILED install -- an
# OIDC validation-rejection case would be told to assert its HelmRelease Ready and
# could not. None exists today; if one is written, the exemption belongs here next
# to the mode gate below rather than as an annotation on the fixture.
#
# The Job rule applies only to a CR that asks for OIDC (`spec.oidc.mode` other
# than the schema's `None` default). The template renders that Job in every mode,
# but at `None` its work is a KamajiControlPlane normalisation unrelated to
# anything here, and a future non-OIDC tenant-cluster suite should not inherit an
# OIDC obligation from a guard named after cleanup.
#
# UNCARRIED BOUND, recorded because the alternative is a recount that expires with
# the session that made it. The mechanism this guard exists for -- a release whose
# install action is still running cannot be uninstalled, so ending a test there
# charges the remainder to `cleanup` -- is written out in full in exactly THREE
# files: docs/agents/e2e-testing.md, this header, and the kubernetes-oidc-system
# fixture where the budget is derived from it. Everything else points at one of
# those. Verified by enumeration at the time of writing, and NOT enforced: an
# attempt to add a @test counting the copies is not in this file, because two runs
# of it disagreed about whether it executed at all and a case that cannot be shown
# to run is worse than none. So a fourth copy will arrive silently. If you are
# about to write one, point instead; if you are reviewing, this is the bound that
# has no guard behind it.
#
# Maintenance tripwire: the synthetic-mutation case asserts that a nested run of
# this file reports exactly SIX @tests. Adding or removing an @test here reds that
# case until the constant beside `base_ran` is updated. Stated here because the
# obligation is otherwise discoverable only from the failure message, which is the
# wrong moment to learn it.
#
# Requires: yq (mikefarah v4+), jq, and python3. yq and jq are `make build-deps`
# requirements; python3 is NOT, so the case that needs it checks for it rather
# than assuming it. Without that check its absence was not a clean skip: two
# cases failed with a message blaming the synthetic fixture, and the mode-gate
# case -- which asserts a GREEN outcome -- passed vacuously. python3 earns its
# place there because two of the breakages restructure YAML rather than
# substitute a line, which sed does not do safely; hack/md-no-hardwrap.bats sets
# the same precedent and guards it the same way.
