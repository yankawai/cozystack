# Behavioural tests for the cluster-capture gate in hack/cozytest.sh.
#
# The runner arms its on-failure cluster captures from an EXIT trap. Those
# captures belong to the e2e suites, which run against a live cluster; a unit
# suite has no cluster to snapshot, so arming them there buys an empty capture
# and pays the capture's timeouts for it. The gate therefore keys on which kind
# of suite is running rather than on whether a kubectl binary happens to be
# installed, because a unit runner has the binary and no cluster.
#
# Both directions are asserted, and they share one fixture generator that
# differs only in the fixture's filename. That pairing is the point: the
# unit-side assertion is a negative one, and a negative assertion passes just as
# well when the harness is broken and nothing ran at all. The e2e-side test is
# the positive control for exactly that failure, and the unit-side test
# additionally pins that the run did fail, so "no captures" cannot be satisfied
# by "no test".
#
# The stub kubectl is what makes this a real test of the gate: with no kubectl
# on PATH every capture leg is skipped for a second reason and both directions
# would agree for the wrong cause.
#
# awk-transform constraint (hack/cozytest.sh rewrites this file before sourcing
# it): it turns any line beginning `@test "` into a function header, and any
# line that is exactly `}` into `return 0` plus the brace. Neither rule knows
# what a heredoc is. So a fixture written as a heredoc here has its own `@test`
# line harvested into THIS suite: the runner registers a phantom extra test,
# runs it first, and the fixture's `false` ends the run before any real test
# executes. Checked by building that variant rather than reasoned about -- it
# fails loudly rather than silently, but it fails the wrong thing, and the gate
# is then covered by nothing. The fixtures are built with printf, which puts the
# `@test` text inside a format string where no rule matches it.
#
# Title syntax constraints (also inherited from that parser):
#   - Titles delimited by ASCII double quotes; embedded quotes truncate.
#   - Only [A-Za-z0-9] from the title survives into the function name, so keep
#     titles distinctive in their alphanumeric run.
#
# Run with: hack/cozytest.sh hack/cozytest-capture-gate.bats
