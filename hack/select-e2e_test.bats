# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Unit tests for hack/select-e2e.sh
#
# cozytest.sh's awk parser recognizes only @test blocks and a bare `}` on its
# own line; there is no bats `run` or `$status`. Each test runs as a shell
# function under `set -eu -x`, so assertions are direct shell tests that exit
# non-zero on failure. setup()/teardown() are not honored — each test creates
# and cleans its own scratch dir.
#
# Run with: hack/cozytest.sh hack/select-e2e_test.bats
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Assert that a selection is the WHOLE suite list, not merely a long one.
#
# These asserts used to read `[ "$(echo "$output" | wc -w)" -gt 5 ]`, which is
# satisfied by any selection of six or more suites. The regression worth
# catching on every escalation path is partial escalation — a selector bug that
# picks most suites but not all — and a threshold cannot see it: with 21 suites
# in the tree, dropping fifteen of them still passes. Equality can.
#
# The expected set is derived the way the script's full-suite branch derives it
# rather than pinned as a literal, so adding or disabling a Chainsaw suite does
# not need an edit in fourteen places here.
#
# A helper rather than an inline one-liner because cozytest.sh runs each @test
# under `set -x`: a bare failing `[ ... ]` prints the two values already
# expanded, but not which side is which, and reading a 21-item diff off a trace
# line is exactly the moment a test stops being worth having.
