# Unit tests for the in-sandbox ghcr.io pull-through mirror (cozystack/cozystack#3513).
#
# hack/e2e-ghcr-mirror.yaml bundles Service + Deployment + CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy
# but they apply in two phases, exactly like the talos-image-cache manifest:
# hack/e2e-install-cozystack.bats applies everything EXCEPT the Cilium policy (its CRD
# does not exist before Cozystack is installed), and hack/e2e-chainsaw/_lib/ghcr-mirror.sh
# applies ONLY that policy later once Cilium is up. These tests pin that split, the
# egress selector/target identities the allow depends on, the pull-through config, and
# the one pure string fragment (ghcr_registry_mirrors_block) whose indentation decides
# whether tenant CRs render at all.
#
# They also cover resolve_ghcr_mirror_endpoint, which is where the helper's safety
# property actually lives: it decides whether tenant workers are pointed at the mirror
# at all, and it caches that decision for every later suite in the shared sandbox. Its
# kubectl calls are stubbed below, so all four outcomes are reachable without a cluster.
#
# cozytest.sh's awk parser recognizes only @test blocks and a bare `}` on its own line;
# there is no bats `run`/`$status`, and setup()/teardown() are not honored. Sourcing
# ghcr-mirror.sh has no cluster side effects (it only sets defaults and defines
# functions). mikefarah yq prints `---` between matched documents.
#
# Run with: hack/cozytest.sh hack/ghcr-mirror_test.bats

# kubectl stub for the resolve_ghcr_mirror_endpoint cases. Each test sets the three
# globals below to pick a branch; every path returns explicitly, because cozytest.sh
