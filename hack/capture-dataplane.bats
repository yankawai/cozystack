# EXIT-TRAP DEBT: 1 -- see hack/bats-no-exit-trap.bats; lower it as the traps go, delete it at zero.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Unit tests for the pure decision/parsing helpers in
# hack/e2e-capture-dataplane.sh -- specifically the LoadBalancer-datapath
# section, which fires for a Service type=LoadBalancer whose external IP is
# unreachable while its backend stays Ready (the NotReady-pod path never sees
# this case). Only the pure logic is unit-testable here:
#
#   - lb_filter_services      -- keep only whole LoadBalancer rows that carry an
#                               ingress IP;
#   - lb_first_ready_endpoint -- pick the first addressed, non-NotReady endpoint;
#   - lb_announcer_node       -- the speaker node of the most recent announce;
#   - lb_capture_decision     -- capture when probes failed, skip when one
#                               succeeded, unknown when none ran or none could.
#   - pod_filter_affected     -- retain scheduled NotReady pods even without IPs,
#                               and only from whole rows.
#   - pod_first_ready         -- pick the healthy-pod baseline for one node out
#                               of the cluster-wide snapshot, whole rows only.
#
# The tests come in two shapes, and neither needs a cluster.
#
# The first sources the script with E2E_CAPTURE_DATAPLANE_LIB set, which the
# sourcing guard honours by defining the helpers and returning before it touches
# $1 or runs any capture. Those tests call the pure helpers directly and assert
# with `[ ... ]`, matching this repo's plain-shell bats convention (no `run`
# helper). Mock IPs use the RFC 5737 / RFC 3849 documentation ranges.
#
# The second runs the script as a subprocess against a stub kubectl on PATH --
# one that hangs, refuses, or answers in part -- and reads what it wrote. That
# reaches the capture body itself, which no amount of sourcing can: the bounds,
# the notes and the difference between "nothing is there" and "the read never
# said" are all properties of the running script, and several of them are only
# observable in the artifact it leaves behind.
#
# A stub has to reach the branch a test is about. Several of these tests walk
# the LB heavy-capture path, which only runs when the probe reports the address
# unreachable, so their stubs answer `nc -z` with a failure on purpose. A stub
# that stops short leaves the test green against every implementation.
#
# Title syntax constraints (inherited from cozytest.sh's awk parser):
#   - Titles delimited by ASCII double quotes; embedded quotes truncate.
#   - Only [A-Za-z0-9] from the title survives into the function name, so keep
#     titles distinctive in their alphanumeric run.
#
# Run with: hack/cozytest.sh hack/capture-dataplane.bats
#           (or `bats hack/capture-dataplane.bats` if the bats binary is
#           installed; cozytest.sh is the CI path.)
