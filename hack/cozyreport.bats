# Unit tests for the pure selection helper in hack/cozyreport.sh that decides
# which pods the report collects evidence for, and which ones
# hack/cozyreport-summary.sh names as broken:
#
#   - cozyreport_pods_not_ready -- keep every pod that is neither finished nor
#                                  fully ready by its READY column. That column
#                                  counts ready containers, not the pod's Ready
#                                  condition; the one case the two disagree on is
#                                  pinned below rather than claimed away.
#
# The kubectl calls those two scripts wrap around this helper are not
# unit-testable (they need a live cluster); the selection is, and it is the part
# that decides whether the pod that caused a failure appears in the uploaded
# report at all. The case that matters is a pod whose STATUS is Running while its
# READY column is 0/1: a readiness probe that never passes blocks everything
# downstream of it, and a STATUS-only filter drops it, so the artifact ends up
# with no trace of the pod the run died on.
#
# Strategy: source hack/cozyreport.sh with COZYREPORT_LIB set, which its
# sourcing guard honours by defining the helpers and returning before it starts a
# report -- so no cluster is required. Each @test then feeds the helper the exact
# text `kubectl get pod -A --no-headers` produces.
#
# Title syntax constraints (inherited from cozytest.sh's awk parser):
#   - Titles delimited by ASCII double quotes; embedded quotes truncate.
#   - Only [A-Za-z0-9] from the title survives into the function name, so keep
#     titles distinctive in their alphanumeric run.
#
# Run with: hack/cozytest.sh hack/cozyreport.bats
#           (or `bats hack/cozyreport.bats` if the bats binary is installed;
#           cozytest.sh is the CI path.)

  # Asserting the two loops by name only guards the two that exist. The defect was
  # that a section without a boundedness test drifted silently, and a section added
  # next month would drift the same way -- so freeze the inventory of reads that do
  # NOT go through the bounded reader. The file deliberately leaves those alone
  # (its header says which sections are in scope and why), but the number must not
  # grow without someone deciding to let it: a new unbounded section moves this
  # count and fails here at the moment it is written, rather than when a degraded
  # apiserver hangs it in production.
  # Frozen as a per-section LIST, not as a total. A total does not distinguish the
  # cases it is counted for: bounding one read in section A while adding an
  # unbounded one to section B leaves the sum unchanged, so the guard stays silent
  # while precisely the thing it exists to catch -- a new section reading straight
  # into the tree -- ships. A swap of that shape leaves the total unmoved and the
  # test green.
  #
  # Keyed by section rather than by line number: line numbers move with any edit
  # above them, which would make this a standing false red that somebody deletes
  # within a week. The list is also its own documentation -- it names which
  # sections still read unbounded, so the follow-up that bounds them has its scope
  # written down here rather than in a comment holding a third copy of the number.
  #
  # LC_ALL=C on the sort: without it the order depends on the caller's collation,
  # so this guard passed on one machine and failed on another with an identical
  # tree. A check whose verdict depends on the environment it runs in is not a
  # check.
  # Section header matched at ANY indentation, redirect matched by SHAPE.
  #
  # Both of those were wrong, and each blinded the guard to one of the two cases
  # the comment above claims it catches. The header pattern was anchored at column
  # zero, so the four sections that sit inside an `if` -- cert-manager,
  # objectstorage, kamaji, linstor -- had their reads credited to whatever
  # top-level section came last; that is why the frozen list said `pvcs=17` when
  # the pvcs section has two. And the redirect pattern was an allowlist of three
  # variable names, so the cert-manager loop writing into `$cdir` was invisible
  # entirely. A new read added in that loop's own style moved nothing, and a swap
  # between two sections sharing a bucket moved nothing either -- the exact swap
  # the comment says per-section keying eliminated. It was verified once, between
  # two sections that happened not to share a bucket.
  #
  # An allowlist of names is the same defect as the marker regex that enumerated
  # known prefixes: it can only see the cases somebody already thought of.
  # Folded before counting, and the redirect matched in both variable spellings:
  # a read whose `>` sits one continuation down, or which writes to `${DIR}/x`
  # rather than `$DIR/x`, is the same unbounded read and was invisible to a
  # pattern that assumed one line and one form.
  # The per-section inventory of unbounded reads that used to sit here is gone,
  # and its replacement is the guard above: every read in the body is bounded, so
  # the counts it froze are all zero and a table of zeroes says less than the
  # sentence does. It was also blind by construction -- it matched a redirect to
  # `$VAR/`, which no gate, selector or command substitution has -- so its numbers
  # were "how many of a section's unbounded reads this pattern can see", and they
  # were quoted as though they were all of them.
  #
  # What stays here is the BOUNDARY every one of these scans rests on. They all
  # look for the bare name, so kubectl invoked by path, through a variable, or
  # under sudo is invisible to them -- and an invisible read is reported as no
  # read at all, which is the strongest possible result and the wrong one. Fail
  # here instead, in the same commit that introduces the spelling.
