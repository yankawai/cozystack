# EXIT-TRAP DEBT: 5 -- see hack/bats-no-exit-trap.bats; lower it as the traps go, delete it at zero.
# Tests for hack/nightly-mirror.sh — the OCIR->GHCR nightly image-mirror selector.
#
# Guards the ref selection and host rewrite: only cozystack-owned component
# images are copied (third-party images and bare upstream tags are skipped, as
# they live in registries this job cannot push to), the cozystack-packages
# artifact is deliberately excluded (it is rebuilt downstream from the rewritten
# tree), and every copy targets the destination registry with the source digest
# preserved.
#
# Harness note: the CI path is hack/cozytest.sh, NOT real bats — see the same
# note in hack/promote-retag_test.bats. No `run`, `$status`, `$output`, `skip`,
# or setup()/teardown(); each @test is a shell function under `set -eu -x`, so a
# non-zero exit aborts the test (that is the exit-0 assertion). A test that
# expects a non-zero exit must capture it with `|| rc=$?`. mikefarah yq is
# assumed present (provided by the test toolchain).
#
# Run with: hack/cozytest.sh hack/nightly-mirror_test.bats

# Build a synthetic baked tree exercising all four image-ref shapes plus the
# refs that MUST be filtered (third-party host, cozystack-packages artifact).
