# Unit tests for platform migration 50 (adopt legacy etcd.aenix.io/v1alpha1
# clusters onto etcd-operator.cozystack.io/v1alpha2 via etcd-migrate).
#
# These drive the real migration script end-to-end against a fake kubectl and a
# fake etcd-migrate (hack/testdata/migration-50/), mocking only the cluster
# boundary — the same approach test/check-readiness uses. Every fake invocation
# is logged so we can assert on the ordering and arguments of the destructive
# steps, which is exactly the contract that cannot be checked by reading the
# script.
#
# The behaviours pinned here are the review blockers:
#   1. the safety snapshot is ALWAYS taken to the platform cozy-backups bucket —
#      never skipped — and the script fails loudly if the target is unresolvable;
#   2. the staged credentials Secret is tenant-invisible (managed-by set,
#      tenantresource stripped); and
#   3. the operator is scaled to 0 BEFORE etcd-migrate --apply and back to 1
#      AFTER, with --apply always carrying the S3 backup destination.
#
# cozytest.sh's awk parser recognizes only @test blocks and a bare `}` on its
# own line; there is no bats `run`/`$status`/`setup`. Assertions are direct
# shell tests that exit non-zero on failure.

# Run with: hack/cozytest.sh hack/migration-50-etcd-adopt.bats
