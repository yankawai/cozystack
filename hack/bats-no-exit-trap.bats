# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The ban on EXIT-trap cleanup in hack/*.bats, and the debt each file that still
# breaks it declares for itself.
#
# Why the ban. An EXIT trap inside an @test body replaces the one the bats binary
# installs for its own bookkeeping, and a test that then FAILS prints no TAP line
# at all. Not `not ok` -- nothing. The run ends with a warning that it executed
# fewer tests than it planned, so anyone reading the tail of the output, or
# grepping it for `not ok`, sees a green suite. Not hypothetical:
# hack/promote-retag_test.bats reported five passes and no failures while six of
# its eleven tests printed nothing. Clean up at the end of the test body instead.
# Both runners set -e, so on failure the cleanup is unreachable and the scratch
# directory survives for inspection, which is what a failed test wants anyway.
# Fuller reasoning, and the two exceptions -- a self-contained trap inside a
# Chainsaw `script` step, and one inside an explicit subshell -- are in
# docs/agents/e2e-testing.md.
#
# The debt belongs to the file that owes it, and not to a central inventory: put
# the count somewhere else and a change that adds a trap has to edit a suite it
# otherwise never opens, so two changes sharing no line invalidate each other --
# both green against their own base, both merging cleanly, red only once the
# second lands.
#
# The declaration is one comment line in the file's leading comment block, under
# the shebang and above the first line of code:
#
#     # EXIT-TRAP DEBT: 12
#
# There and not merely somewhere, because a .bats file is shell that writes
# shell: the same line inside a heredoc, a fixture or an expected-output string
# is data belonging to one test, and honouring it there would let an unrelated
# fixture excuse a real trap. The leading comment block rather than everything
# above the first @test, because helper functions and their heredocs sit between
# the two; a comment block is the region with no interior.
#
# It is exact, not a ceiling. Adding a trap fails; removing one fails too, and
# the fix is to lower the number, or delete the line once it reaches zero. A file
# with no declaration must hold no traps, which covers the converted files, the
# files that never had one, and every file added tomorrow.
#
# NOT every counted handler is debt. A trap inside an explicit subshell does not
# replace the bats binary's own, so a test that fails inside `( ... )` still
# prints its `not ok` -- verified under Bats 1.14.0 against a test-level trap in
# the same file, where the TAP line vanishes. hack/e2e-test-openapi.bats holds
# one: it kills a background `kubectl proxy` from a trap inside a subshell, and
# moving that to the end of the body would leak the process on failure instead of
# suppressing a report. Its declaration says so, and because the ratchet is
# exact, REMOVING that trap fails too -- the count protects the construct rather
# than scheduling it for deletion.
#
# The limits are worth stating rather than discovering. The scan is lexical: a
# signal computed at runtime (`trap cleanup "$sig"`) is invisible, and so is a
# handler whose quoted action spans physical lines without a backslash, since
# only backslash continuations are folded. In the other direction the word is
# counted where no command exists -- inside a heredoc, or in a string a test
# compares against -- which inflates a file's debt rather than hiding one, and is
# why the fixture writers below assemble the keyword and the signal from separate
# arguments. `trap - EXIT`, which DISARMS a handler, scores as an install for the
# same inflating reason. An exact count catches addition and removal but never
# SUBSTITUTION: swap the openapi file's subshell trap for a test-level one and
# the total stays 1, the guard stays green, and that file's "this one is NOT
# debt" note quietly becomes false.
#
# The scan reads .bats and nothing else, so a handler reaching a test body from a
# sourced .sh is invisible to it. Not theoretical:
# hack/e2e-chainsaw/_lib/run-kubernetes.sh installs two, each benign for its own
# reason rather than by design -- cozy_capture_tenant_talos is declared with `(`
# and so runs in a subshell, and the diagnostics tests DO call it, so flipping
# its two delimiters to braces reinstates that handler in them with the guard
# green; run_kubernetes_test is declared with `{`, the shape that would bite, and
# is benign only because no @test calls it.
#
# The marker is anchored at column zero. That is NOT what protects the example
# above -- the nested `#` does, and relaxing the anchor leaves this file's own
# audit green. What the anchor buys is that a marker indented inside a function
# body or a heredoc somewhere else is not read as that file's declaration, and a
# file that indents its own reports "declares none" and fails loudly rather than
# passing quietly. Reflowing the example above to column zero would make the
# guard demand a debt of twelve from a file holding nothing.
#
# None of that makes the guard a proof that a file installs no handler; it is a
# ratchet over a known and common spelling. A suite reporting zero failures still
# has to have its `1..N` plan reconciled against its `ok` count, which is the
# check that catches whatever the pattern missed.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The directory to audit. Under the bats binary that is this file's own
# location; under cozytest.sh, which does not set BATS_TEST_FILENAME, `$0` is
# the runner itself -- and the answer comes out the same only because the runner
# lives in the directory it runs files from. The first test below refuses to
# pass on an empty enumeration, so a wrong answer here fails rather than audits
# nothing.

# What an installed EXIT handler looks like.
#
# `0` as well as `EXIT`: POSIX names the exit condition signal 0, and both shells
# install the identical handler for it, so a pattern that knows only the spelling
# it has seen tests the spelling and not the construct. `EXIT` anywhere in the
# signal list rather than only as its last word: `trap ... EXIT HUP` installs the
# same exit handler plus one more, and anchoring to end-of-line accepts it. A
# quote around the signal, because `trap cleanup 'EXIT'` installs exactly what
# `trap cleanup EXIT` installs -- the quote is punctuation, not a different
# construct. The quote is optional around the SIGNAL only and never after the
# keyword, so `'trap'` as a shell argument stays unmatched; the fixture writers
# below depend on that to keep their own test data from reading as real traps.
#
# The signal ends at any character that cannot continue an identifier, not at
# whitespace. `trap ... EXIT; cd "$tmp"` and `(trap ... EXIT)` are both real
# handlers with punctuation straight after the word, and a terminator demanding
# whitespace or end-of-line scores them zero -- guard green, no declaration
# asked for. Excluding the identifier characters is what keeps `EXIT_CODE` from
# matching, which is the reason the narrower terminator looked right.
#
# The signal matches in either case, because the shell accepts it in either
# case: `trap ... exit` installs the handler `trap ... EXIT` installs, in bash
# and in dash alike. The folding is spelled into the alternation rather than
# running the whole pattern case-insensitively, since `trap` is a builtin name
# and `TRAP ... EXIT` is not a command anyone installs.
#
# The keyword needs its left boundary as much as the signal needs its right
# one, and for the same reason. `bootstrap ` ends in `trap `, so once the
# terminator accepts punctuation, `talosctl bootstrap -n ... ; do sleep 0.5`
# scores as a handler on the `0`. That is loud rather than silent, but not
# harmless: the documented answer to a red guard is to add a debt line, so a
# file would buy a permanent licence for one real trap in order to quiet a line
# that has none.
#
# Both boundaries are therefore spelled the same way -- any character that
# cannot be part of an identifier -- and NOT as whitespace. Whitespace on the
# left drops `tmp=$(mktemp -d);trap ... EXIT` and `(trap ... EXIT; true)`, which
# are the banned construct behind a semicolon and a paren. The first of those is
# the sharper lesson: the inventory this replaces carried no left boundary at
# all and caught it, so a boundary chosen carelessly here would have narrowed
# coverage while the commit message claimed to widen it.
