# Emit the JSON build matrix (the list of package dirs to build) for CI.
#
# Single source of truth: the `make -C packages/<dir> image` lines in the root
# Makefile `build:` target. Parsing them here keeps the CI matrix from drifting
# away from what `make build` actually builds.
#
# Usage: hack/build-matrix.sh [<changed-files>]
#   no arg / empty / "FULL" -> every build unit (full matrix)
#   <changed-files>         -> only the units whose package dir has a changed
#                              file, UNLESS a shared-dependency path changed, in
#                              which case the full matrix is emitted (a change to
#                              cozy-lib / the build macros / go.mod / the build
#                              workflows can affect any image, so rebuild all).
#
# Output: a JSON array of package dirs on stdout, e.g.
#   ["packages/apps/mariadb","packages/system/dashboard"]
# An empty selection prints `[]` -> the matrix produces zero build jobs.

# The build units, parsed from the `build:` recipe (from `build:` to the next
# line that starts in column 0).
#
# packages/core/talos, packages/core/installer and packages/system/vyos-router-image
# are deliberately excluded from the parallel matrix and handled by dedicated jobs
# instead:
#   - talos:            the nocloud disk image and the installer tarball are heavy
#                       and shared through _out/assets; built once in an always-on
#                       leg (e2e needs the disk on every non-docs PR regardless of
#                       scoping).
#   - installer:        its `flux push artifact --path=packages` bundles the
#                       ENTIRE, digest-patched packages tree into the OCI artifact
#                       the operator pulls, so it must run in the finalize step
#                       AFTER every other unit's digest edits are merged — never
#                       concurrently with them.
#   - vyos-router-image: a full VyOS live-build (debootstrap + apt + squashfs) in a
#                       privileged container, far heavier than a normal image
#                       build; built in its own build-vyos leg (see the workflow).
