# Unit tests for the SeaweedFS db-split hand-over shared by platform migrations
# 43 (original) and 53 (repair) — lib/seaweedfs-db-adopt.sh.
#
# The 1.5.0 split (PR #2601) moved Cluster/seaweedfs-db out of the <name>-system
# release into a new <name>-db release. The hand-over must, before <name>-system
# next renders, re-own the Cluster to <name>-db AND stamp
# helm.sh/resource-policy: keep — otherwise the <name>-system upgrade prunes the
# Cluster as a removed resource, CNPG takes its PVC with it, and the tenant's
# filer metadata (all of its S3) is gone.
#
# Three properties are pinned here, each of which shipped broken:
#
#  1. INSTANCE NAME. Migration 43 compared the owner against the literal
#     "seaweedfs-system". `SeaweedFS` is user-creatable, so an instance named
#     `foo` is owned by `foo-system` and was silently skipped. Observed live:
#     four default-named tenants carry release-name=seaweedfs-db + keep and their
#     Clusters survived; the one tenant running `foo` has no Cluster at all.
#
#  2. OWNERSHIP IS NOT SAFETY. A Cluster already owned by <name>-db can still
#     need keep: where the hand-over was skipped, <name>-system prunes it and
#     <name>-db RECREATES it under its own ownership with no keep, while
#     <name>-system's prune baseline still lists it. Live proof that the shape is
#     real: tenant-l and tenant-root are <name>-db-owned and their <name>-system
#     deployed revision still contains the Cluster — only keep saves them.
#
#  3. FAIL CLOSED. Migrations never re-run, so a swallowed error permanently
#     leaves at-risk tenants exposed. `for ns in $(kubectl ...)` does not trip
#     errexit: on failure the loop runs zero times and the script stamps the
#     version anyway. Only "the resource type is not served" (no CNPG at all) and
#     "gone between scan and read" may be treated as empty.
#
# These drive the real migration scripts end-to-end against a fake kubectl
# (hack/testdata/migration-seaweedfs-db/), mocking only the cluster boundary.
#
# SHELL. Production runs these under /bin/sh = busybox ash: the migrations image
# is FROM alpine, and run-migrations.sh execs `/migrations/<n>` BY PATH, so the
# kernel honours the `#!/bin/sh` shebang. `set -euo pipefail` and
# errexit-in-function semantics differ from bash, and pipefail is load-bearing —
# lib/cozystack-version.sh pipes the rendered manifest into `kubectl apply`, so
# without it a failed render stamps the version from empty input. Asserting
# fail-closed in a shell that never runs it would be asserting nothing.
#
# So these tests do not invoke the migrations through the runner's shell at all:
# run_migration() executes them by path inside the image's own pinned base, read
# from the migrations Dockerfile. Same base image, same interpreter, same
# invocation form — production, rather than an approximation of it. This needs a
# working docker; there is deliberately no host-shell fallback, because every
# fallback available is a shell production never uses.
#
# What that replaced was `sh "$MIG_DIR/<n>"`, which is neither production nor
# bash: on the GitHub ubuntu runner /bin/sh is dash, which has no `set -o
# pipefail` and aborts on line 1 with "set: Illegal option -o pipefail" before
# the script does any work, while on a developer box /bin/sh is often bash, which
# runs green and proves nothing about ash.
#
# cozytest.sh's awk parser recognizes only @test blocks and a bare `}` on its
# own line; there is no bats `run`/`$status`/`setup`. Assertions are direct
# shell tests that exit non-zero on failure.

# the container and $WORK is bind-mounted, so $FAKE_CMDLOG is the same file the
# assertions read back on the host. --network none because nothing here may
# reach a real cluster; --user keeps $WORK removable by the test afterwards.
#
# The explicit `return` is load-bearing: cozytest.sh's awk generator rewrites
# every bare `}` in column 0 into `return 0` + `}`, so a helper that falls off
# its own end returns 0 no matter what it ran, and every fail-closed assertion
# below would pass vacuously. Capture the status and return it by hand.
