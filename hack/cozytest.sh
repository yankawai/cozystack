# Per-file lifecycle hook. cozytest.sh runs each .bats as a single invocation
# and exit()s on the first failing @test, so this EXIT trap is the one place to:
#   1. on failure, snapshot the HOST cluster with crust-gather BEFORE any cleanup,
#      so each failed test keeps its own inspectable state instead of one
#      end-of-suite dump;
#   2. ALWAYS run the file's cozy_cleanup() if it defines one, so a test never
#      leaks resources into the shared tenant-test namespace (left-behind PVCs
#      otherwise exhaust the tenant quota and cascade-fail every later app).
# cozy_cleanup is a plain shell function a .bats file may define — there are no
# bats setup/teardown directives here, this runner only knows @test + bash.
# NOTE: nested tenant clusters are NOT captured here. This trap runs in the
# parent shell after the failing test subshell has exited and reaped its
# port-forward, and crust-gather can only reach a tenant via that localhost
# forward — so a test that creates tenant clusters (run-kubernetes.sh) captures
# them from its OWN in-subshell EXIT trap, while the forward is still alive.
COZY_REPORT_DIR="${COZY_REPORT_DIR:-_out/cozyreport}"
# Which suites get the cluster captures below. They read cluster state, so they
# belong to the e2e suites and to nothing else. `command -v kubectl` does not
# tell the two apart: a unit runner has the binary and no cluster, so a red unit
# test used to walk into the legs below on its way out.
#
# What that costs depends on how kubectl fails. Against an endpoint that refuses
# immediately it is a second; against one that hangs -- an unreachable address, a
# context left pointing at a torn-down cluster -- it was measured at ~28s for the
# previous-logs leg, which self-bounds its pod list and so never reaches the 300s
# ceiling set below it. The data-plane leg bounds its own reads as well, 28s for
# a list and 20s for a single read, so it returns in tens of seconds rather than
# holding its 600s ceiling. Dead waiting inside a job budget either way, for a
# failure that should cost seconds.
#
# Where crust-gather is installed as well the bill stops being empty and starts
# being wrong: that leg does not need a reachable cluster to be pointless, it
# needs an ambient KUBECONFIG, and it can hold the trap for 390s -- its 360s
# deadline plus the -k 30 kill grace -- snapshotting whatever cluster the
# current context happens to name.
#
# The discriminator is the e2e- prefix, on the suite's own name or on the
# directory holding it. At the top level the prefix is what the project already
# sorts on: the Makefile builds BATS_UNIT_FILES as
# $(filter-out hack/e2e-%.bats,$(wildcard hack/*.bats)), so a top-level e2e-*
# suite is precisely one `make unit-tests` refuses to run and
# packages/core/testing/Makefile runs against a live cluster instead.
#
# That wildcard is not recursive, so it says nothing about subdirectories, and a
# live-cluster suite grouped into an e2e-* subdirectory carries no prefix on its
# own filename. Matching the directory too keeps such a suite armed; matching
# only the basename would take the captures away from a suite that needs them,
# which is the opposite of the fix. Neither test is a claim that every future
# live-cluster suite will be named this way -- it is the only signal the runner
# has, and a suite placed outside both shapes gets no captures.
#
# Nor is either test a claim that a runner exists. The prefix arms the captures;
# hack/bats-runner-coverage.bats is what fails when a suite is run by nothing.
# Conflating the two is how two suites once sat unexecuted in hack/e2e-apps/ for
# three weeks.
#
# Deliberately not a reachability probe. Gating on "can I talk to an apiserver"
# would disarm the captures in the case they exist for: a failing e2e run is
# often one whose apiserver is degraded, and a probe answering "no" there would
# skip the snapshot precisely when it is the evidence.
