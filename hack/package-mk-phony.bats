# Unit tests for the .PHONY declarations this tree depends on: the one in
# hack/package.mk, which most package Makefiles under packages/ include, and the
# root Makefile's, where one target is already shadowed by a real path.
#
# `.PHONY=a b c` assigns a variable; `.PHONY: a b c` declares targets. Only the
# second does anything, and make reports neither. The declaration lists the nine
# targets package.mk defines and stops there.
#
# `update` and `image` are deliberately absent: package.mk does not define them,
# the including package Makefile does, and naming an undefined target in .PHONY
# creates it as an empty target. That turns "No rule to make target" (exit 2)
# into "Nothing to be done" (exit 0) wherever the rule is missing, including the
# CI build matrix, which is parsed from the root Makefile `build:` target and
# runs `make -C <pkg> image` per unit. The last two tests pin the exclusion.
#
# The first test is narrower than its name suggests, in two ways. It probes the
# names on the `.PHONY:` line, so it cannot see a name dropped from that line;
# the set-equality test is what guards every name's presence. And it decides by
# matching make's "is up to date", which make prints only for a target that has
# a recipe. A recipe-less alias prints "Nothing to be done" whether or not the
# declaration works, so the first test would pass on such a name either way.
# Every target package.mk defines has a recipe, so nothing is uncovered today,
# and the control test below catches that shape regardless. Add an alias here
# and the first test stops covering it.
#
# The decoy files all carry one fixed timestamp, and that is load-bearing rather
# than tidy. Six of the nine targets take `check` as a prerequisite, and `apply`
# and `delete` reach it through `suspend` as well. Touch the decoys in list order
# and `check` lands newer than the targets that depend on it, so make rebuilds
# them for that reason alone and prints a recipe whatever `.PHONY` says. The
# probe then reports success against the broken form. Equal mtimes remove the
# question: nothing is ever newer than its own prerequisite, in any list order,
# so the recipe running means phony and nothing else. Measured on GNU Make 4.3,
# which is what CI runs, list order hid the bug for up to six of the nine, and
# which six moved with where the clock tick fell. On 3.81 the whole loop landed
# inside one timestamp and hid nothing, so a local run could not see it.
#
# Constraints on anyone editing this file: every make invocation is pinned to
# LC_ALL=C, because the assertions match English make wording; cozytest.sh
# recognizes only @test blocks and a bare `}` at column 0, and injects `set -e`,
# so exit statuses are captured explicitly rather than tested inline.
#
# Run with: hack/cozytest.sh hack/package-mk-phony.bats
