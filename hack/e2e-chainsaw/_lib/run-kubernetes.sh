# Name the console experiment's own failure before the noise starts. Enabling
# logSerialConsole punches through the platform's cluster-wide disable, and if
# kubevirt/kubevirt#15989 still bites, guest-console-log wedges virt-launcher
# in Init: the workers never boot, no Node registers, and the suite reports
# "fewer than 2 tenant nodes Ready within 18m" -- byte-identical to the failure
# this instrumentation was added to study. A triager reading that line files it
# as the known flake and the experiment's answer is lost at the bottom of
# POD-STATE.txt. A diagnostic whose own worst case is disguised as the bug it
# investigates is worth less than none, so it says so itself, and says it
# first.
#
# The bit it reads is `ready` on the init container. This sidecar is built with
# no probes at all, and kubelet's UpdatePodStatus sets `ready = !exists` for a
# container with no readiness worker once it is running -- liveness is not an
# input to readiness anywhere. So the bit is exactly "the container is
# running", and false means not running: never-started, waiting between
# restarts, or already-terminated. Running-but-not-ready is not a shape this
# container can hold, which is why the taxonomy below does not claim it.
# Those are not one finding: the hang starts the container and then fails it,
# so with restartPolicy Always it settles into CrashLoopBackOff and passes
# through Error, while a superseded virt-launcher from a VM restart exits
# cleanly and terminates Completed. ContainerState is a union, so a waiting
# reason alone leaves the terminated case blank and cannot tell the two apart.
# Both reasons are carried so each shape arrives labelled.
#
# Even so this line points rather than concludes, and it says so out loud: the
# bit cannot separate every shape, the describe that follows can, and a
# headline that asserts more than the bit carries is the same mislabel this
# function exists to prevent, merely pointing the other way.

# Capture each tenant worker's guest serial console from the management
# cluster. When a node group sets logSerialConsole, KubeVirt streams the
# console into a guest-console-log container beside virt-launcher, and reading
# it needs nothing from inside the guest: no talosctl, no client certificate,
# no helper Pod, no reachable apid. That is the whole reason it exists. The
# talosctl capture below can only describe a worker whose apid already answers,
# so a worker that stalls earlier -- the case where no Node registers and no
# certificate request is ever made -- is invisible to it by construction, and
# the console is the only remaining surface.
#
# Reads start at the beginning of the stream rather than tailing it, because a
# guest that repaints its console would push the boot output out of any tail
# window while --limit-bytes truncates from the far end instead. That covers
# only what kubectl returns: whatever the kubelet has already rotated out of
# the container log (containerLogMaxSize, 10Mi x 5 by default) is gone before
# the capture runs, and no read option recovers it.
#
# An absent guest-console-log container is the finding, not a gap: it says
# console logging did not take effect on this run, which is a different fact
# from a guest that printed nothing. kubectl's refusal is kept beside the
# capture rather than inside it so the two stay distinguishable, and the
# capture file says which of them happened.
#
# The Pod list is namespace-wide rather than scoped to one release. The two
# virt-launcher captures immediately above the call site already select that
# way, and suites run one at a time. Below the cap a Pod that does not belong
# to this test costs one extra file named after itself and nothing else; at
# the cap it can displace one of this suite's own, since kubectl returns the
# list name-sorted. COLLECTION-TRUNCATED.txt is what keeps that visible.

#
# The rejection names no unit, because three of its four callers are seconds and the
# fourth is a Pod count: telling someone their importer cap must be "integer seconds"
# describes the wrong quantity, and the whole point of these notes is that they say
# something true about what was seen.
#
# Every knob below is pasted somewhere that accepts digits and nothing else, and
# each fails differently and quietly:
#
#   COZY_DIAG_PHASE_BUDGET=8m  -- goes into $(( )) inside cozy_diag_phase_start,
#     which is the FIRST statement of the diagnostics block. The arithmetic error
#     unwinds the whole function before its own headline, so the failing run
#     produces no diagnostics at all, only the shell's complaint. The worst
#     outcome on this path, arrived at through a knob.
#   COZY_DIAG_READ_TIMEOUT=2m  -- becomes --request-timeout=2ms and every read
#     fails instantly, so every note blames the cluster for a value.
#   COZY_DIAG_MAX_IMPORTERS=3s -- `[ n -gt 3s ]` exits 2, the `if` reads false and
#     the cap silently stops existing, which is the term this block capped on
#     purpose.
#
# A leading zero is rejected along with a suffix, and it is the arm that is easy to
# leave out. `0480` is all digits, so a digits-only check passes it through, and
# then `$(( ))` reads it as octal and fails exactly as `8m` does -- same total loss
# of the block, one character less obvious. For the read bound the same value is
# quieter and worse: `timeout -k 5 0480` is 480 seconds, so the per-call bound this
# whole change exists to add would be 24 times wider than the number says.
#
# Rejecting and naming the fallback is what the rest of this tree does with its own
# knobs, including this arm: hack/e2e-capture-previous-logs.sh rejects a zero or
# leading-zero COZY_PREVLOG_TAIL for the same octal reason, and
# docs/agents/e2e-testing.md records that contract.
# A fourth argument, any non-empty value, rejects zero as well; it is a flag rather
# than a bound, and the call site spells it `positive`. Zero is all digits and
# passes every check above, and `timeout -k 5 0` disables the timeout outright while
# `--request-timeout=0s` means "no timeout" to kubectl -- the defect this change
# exists to remove, reachable through the knob it adds. The phase budget must keep
# accepting zero: the suite uses it to mean "already spent".

# Wall-clock budget for the on-failure diagnostics phase as a whole, on top of the
# per-read bounds above, because the two buy different things. A per-read bound
# buys forward progress: one hung call can no longer eat the step. It does not buy
# an end to the phase, and the collectors on this path can together spend more than
# what is left of the op by the time it runs. Bounding every read and stopping
# there would have made the arithmetic in kubernetes-*/chainsaw-test.yaml legible
# and still false.
#
# So the phase is bounded as a phase. Once the budget is spent, the collectors that
# have not started are declined out loud instead of attempted, which keeps the one
# artifact that must survive reachable: the tenant crust-gather snapshot the
# caller's `exit 1` triggers.
#
# The budget is derived rather than chosen, from
#
#   budget + largest overshoot + snapshot <= op - bringup
#
# Every term but the budget belongs to something else: the op ceiling lives in both
# kubernetes-*/chainsaw-test.yaml, the snapshot's bound is on the crust-gather call
# above, and bringup is an observed figure rather than a ceiling. The overshoot
# term exists because admission gates when a collector may START, not when it ends,
# so one admitted a moment before the deadline still runs its whole cost. The
# default below is the largest whole minute under the bound that inequality gives.
# hack/run-kubernetes-node-join_test.bats holds the inequality against the code, so
# a later change cannot raise the budget past what the collectors leave room for.
#
# `largest` is a literal in that guard, taken from the heaviest collector at the
# pool's MINIMUM size, which makes it a floor and not a ceiling: the guest-Talos
# walk carries no cap, so a bigger pool makes that collector cost more than the
# figure the budget was derived against. Nor does it cover the collectors with no
# wall-clock bound at all. On the guest-Talos path the applies, waits and deletes
# carry `--request-timeout`/`--timeout`, which bounds one HTTP request rather than
# a client retrying against a wedged apiserver, and the image-cache re-probe makes
# unbounded calls of its own. Both are tracked in cozystack/cozystack#3666. So no
# worst case is claimed here, and none can be stated while that holds.
#
# What the budget buys, exactly and only, is that no collector is STARTED once it
# is spent, so the snapshot is never queued behind work begun past the deadline.
# That is how the snapshot was being lost.
#
# Admission is "the budget is not spent yet" rather than "this collector fits in
# what is left", and that is a choice. Sizing admission per collector would hold
# the phase to its budget exactly, and would also decline the guest-Talos capture
# on a merely slow run, throwing away the only in-guest evidence to protect a
# snapshot that was not yet in danger. Start-gating leaves that to the cheap-first
# order below, and the image-cache diagnosis is the collector this budget gives up

# Assert that one HelmRelease was not torn down in a way its own configuration
# says cannot happen. $1 is the namespace, $2 the release name. Returns non-zero
# on such a teardown or on a read that failed, so the caller's errexit fails the
# run.
#
# One rule decides the verdict: fail when the release was REMOVED although it is
# configured never to remove itself to recover. An "uninstalled" Snapshot is
# proof of removal, and two configurations can write it - the default strategy's
# install remediation, which uninstalls before retrying, and an upgrade
# remediation set to strategy: uninstall, which nothing under packages/ sets. So
# on a release running RetryOnFailure, where neither applies, an "uninstalled"
# Snapshot has no explanation inside the release and fails the run: that is the
# tenant CNI and CSI (moved to RetryOnFailure precisely to take the teardown
# away) and every Application HelmRelease, which the aggregated apiserver stamps
# the same way.
#
# Everything else is reported and left green, and that includes an "uninstalled"
# Snapshot on a release still using the default strategy. Those addons pair it
# with remediation.retries: -1, which is a configuration that declares
# uninstall-and-reinstall their recovery path; the run has no measurement of how
# often they take it, and failing a 25-minute bringup on a release doing what it
# is configured to do is how a guard ends up switched off. That the configuration
# is itself the defect is true and is not this guard's to assert - it is filed
# separately. A "failed" Snapshot is reported for the same reason and one more:
# under RetryOnFailure it is not even remediation, just an attempt that kept its
# manifests and was retried.
#
# Both probes keep their exit status. A failed read and a field the object does
# not carry both print nothing, so folding them together (`|| true` on the whole
# substitution) would let an API timeout or an RBAC error pass for a release with
# no history - the same misreading cozy_tenant_drained guards against with its
# "err" sentinel. `if ! var=$(…)` keeps the non-zero status from tripping the
# errexit the caller runs under.
#
# kubectl's stderr is deliberately NOT folded into the values either. kubectl
# writes warnings there while exiting 0 - a deprecation notice, or the discovery
# noise a degraded aggregated APIService produces - and such a line landing in
# the history capture makes an empty history look populated, which skips the
# readiness branch below, while in the strategy-and-readiness capture it stops
# the value matching RetryOnFailure and silently downgrades a teardown to a
# note. Left unredirected, those lines go to the script's own stderr, which is
# where a reader wants them anyway.

# B1 regression coverage (PR #2872 review). The tenant's default StorageClass
# must be chosen among the *propagated* classes and must never be the legacy
# "kubevirt" alias -- even when the management cluster exposes only remote
# LINSTOR classes whose names sort alphabetically after "kubevirt" and none is
# named the configured storageClass (default "replicated"). That is the
# feature's own multi-tier target configuration. A regressed `sortAlpha | first`
# over a candidate set that still contained the inserted "kubevirt" alias would
# pick it, pointing the tenant default at an infra class absent on the
# management cluster -> default PVCs stay Pending with no error surfaced.
#
# helm-unittest cannot reach this branch: with no live cluster Helm `lookup`
# returns empty, so the storageClasses map always collapses to the "replicated"
# fallback (see packages/apps/kubernetes/tests/csi_test.yaml). It is therefore
# exercised here against the live management cluster with a single server-side
# dry-run render (helm v4 executes `lookup` against the API): add two remote
# LINSTOR classes that sort after "kubevirt", remove "replicated" for the one
# render, restore it immediately, then assert on the rendered -csi HelmRelease's
