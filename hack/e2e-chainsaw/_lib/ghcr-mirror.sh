# Shared helper: point tenant Kubernetes e2e worker nodes at the in-sandbox
# ghcr.io pull-through registry (hack/e2e-ghcr-mirror.yaml) when it is up, via the
# chart's `talos.registryMirrors` knob, otherwise emit nothing so workers fall back
# to pulling ghcr.io directly.
#
# Why: tenant worker Talos nodes pull `ghcr.io/siderolabs/kubelet` directly; that
# egress is flaky/rate-limited from the CI runner and the pull times out with a TLS
# handshake timeout, so the kubelet service never starts and no tenant node joins.
# Diagnosed in cozystack/cozystack#3548 (in-guest Talos dmesg), tracked by #3513.
# Same flaky-public-egress class the talos-image-cache (#3231) fixed for the OS image.
# One variant of that flake, not the whole of it: #3513 also records failures that
# lose the budget before Talos ever reaches the kubelet pull, and those this cannot
# touch.
#
# WHAT THE GATE BELOW ESTABLISHES, precisely, because it is easy to overstate: the
# Deployment went Available, and the API accepted the egress allow. Neither observes
# the tenant-side datapath. If the allow selects an identity the worker's pull does
# not actually carry (see assumption 2 in hack/e2e-ghcr-mirror.yaml), workers are
# pointed at a ClusterIP whose SYNs are dropped, and Talos burns a TCP connect
# timeout per pull before falling back to ghcr.io -- slower than not mirroring at
# all, on exactly the runs this exists to protect. So: the fallback paths cannot
# make CI worse, the committed path is only as safe as the assumptions listed
# there.
#
# talos-image-cache.sh gates the equivalent decision on a byte-level 206 from a Pod
# carrying the consumer's own label, which is what turns that assumption into a
# measurement. Doing the same here is the hardening follow-up, and it is also what
# would let the suite assert the mirror served the pull rather than the worker
# quietly falling back.

# ghcr_warm_job_manifest <image> <tag>...: print the warm-up Job, or fail.
#
# Pure string builder, kept separate so it can be unit-tested, same reason
# talos-image-cache.sh keeps its probe overrides out of the caller.
#
# The Job asks the mirror for each tag's index, every manifest the index lists, and
# every blob those manifests reference, discarding the bytes. distribution's proxy
# populates its blobstore on the way past, so the tenant worker's later pull is a
# local cache hit instead of a live fetch across the leg that stalls.
#
# "On the way past" is not free, and the cost is worth stating exactly. In
# distribution 2.8 a local miss reads the blob from upstream TWICE: ServeBlob starts
# `go storeLocal(...)`, which copies remote -> local, and separately runs
# copyContent(ctx, dgst, w) to serve the client; both open remoteStore. There is no
# tee. So a warm-up blob GET crosses the throttled leg twice.
#
# What keeps that from being a net addition is warming ONE platform per tag -- the
# one the workers run. Then the Job fetches the same blobs the first worker would
# have fetched, and the 2x is paid once either way: by the Job now, or by the worker
# later inside its node-Ready budget. Walking both platforms broke exactly this: the
# arm64 half is bytes nobody in the sandbox pulls, so it was a true addition to the
# leg, and the claim that the total was unchanged was false while it was there.
#
# The byte figures below are image sizes, not measurements of the mirror's upstream
# side, so read them as a lower bound on install-time egress.
#
# Selecting linux/amd64 out of the index stays a grep because digest and platform
# share a record: normalise the whitespace, split on record boundaries, take the
# record that names the architecture. Pulling every sha256 out of a document is a grep,
# and a digest that turns out not to be a blob answers 404. That is free on the
# manifest leg, where the walk just moves on; on the blob leg a 404 counts as a miss
# and fails the Job, which is what a single-arch tag would do -- its config and layer
# digests are not manifests, so the walk finds no index to descend.
